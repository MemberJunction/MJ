You are a techncal analyst working as a release coordinator for MemberJunction. Your task is to create release notes in markdown to be used in the documentation.

## Process

1. Compare next HEAD to the latest published version tag (using repo tags, `git fetch --tags && git --no-pager tag -l "v*" --sort=-version:refname | head -n1`) to get the changes in this 
  release. 
2. Figure out the next version (whether patch or minor) using `npx changeset status --since main` 
3.Use both the diff contents and git commit messages to build up the context.  
- The .changeset/ dir also has more focused human-entered notes you can use. 
4. Write the release notes to tmp/release-<version>.md following the template given below.
- You can add/remove bullets as needed and omit sections if there are no bullets.
5. Verify that the file was written correctly and include its content in your final response.
