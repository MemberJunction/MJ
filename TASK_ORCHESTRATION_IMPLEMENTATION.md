# Task Orchestration Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented multi-step task orchestration for the Conversation Manager, enabling complex workflows where multiple AI agents work in sequence or parallel with dependency management and data passing between tasks.

## Components Implemented

### 1. TaskOrchestrator Service
**File**: `/packages/MJServer/src/services/TaskOrchestrator.ts`

**Purpose**: Core service that handles task orchestration logic.

**Key Features**:
- Creates tasks from LLM-generated task graphs
- Manages task dependencies using existing TaskEntity and TaskDependencyEntity
- Executes tasks in proper order based on dependencies
- Passes outputs from one task as inputs to dependent tasks
- Handles both sequential and parallel execution patterns

**Key Methods**:
- `createTasksFromGraph()` - Creates database task records from LLM response
- `executeTasksForConversation()` - Finds and executes eligible tasks
- `findEligibleTasks()` - Identifies tasks ready for execution (no incomplete dependencies)
- `executeTask()` - Runs a single task via AgentRunner
- `mergePayloads()` - Handles data passing with @taskX.output references

**Data Storage**:
- Input payloads stored in Task.Description with `__TASK_METADATA__` markers
- Output payloads stored in Task.Description with `__TASK_OUTPUT__` markers
- This is a temporary solution until InputPayload/OutputPayload columns are added

### 2. TaskOrchestrationResolver
**File**: `/packages/MJServer/src/resolvers/TaskResolver.ts`

**Purpose**: GraphQL resolver that exposes task orchestration to clients.

**Mutation**:
```graphql
ExecuteTaskGraph(
  taskGraphJson: String!
  conversationDetailId: String!
  environmentId: String!
): ExecuteTaskGraphResult
```

**Returns**:
- Success/failure status
- Array of task execution results with outputs
- Error messages for failed tasks

### 3. Conversation Manager Prompt Update
**File**: `/metadata/prompts/templates/conversations/conversation-manager-agent.template.md`

**Added Section 4**: Agent Orchestration with two modes:

#### Single-Step Delegation (Existing)
```json
{
  "newElements": {
    "invokeAgent": "agentName",
    "reasoning": "brief reason"
  }
}
```

#### Multi-Step Task Orchestration (New)
```json
{
  "newElements": {
    "taskGraph": {
      "isMultiStep": true,
      "reasoning": "explanation",
      "tasks": [
        {
          "tempId": "task1",
          "name": "Task Name",
          "description": "Task description",
          "agentName": "Agent Name",
          "dependsOn": [],
          "inputPayload": { "key": "value" }
        },
        {
          "tempId": "task2",
          "name": "Dependent Task",
          "description": "Uses output from task1",
          "agentName": "Another Agent",
          "dependsOn": ["task1"],
          "inputPayload": {
            "data": "@task1.output",
            "otherParam": "value"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### 4. Integration Documentation
**File**: `/packages/MJServer/src/services/TaskOrchestration-Integration.md`

Comprehensive guide for integrating TaskOrchestrator into existing resolvers with examples and testing scenarios.

## Architecture Design

### Task Flow
1. User sends complex multi-step request to Conversation Manager
2. Conversation Manager LLM analyzes request and generates task graph
3. TaskOrchestrationResolver receives task graph
4. TaskOrchestrator creates Task and TaskDependency records
5. TaskOrchestrator executes tasks in waves:
   - Wave 1: Tasks with no dependencies
   - Wave 2: Tasks whose dependencies are complete
   - Continue until all tasks complete or a task fails
6. Task outputs passed to dependent tasks via payload merging
7. Results returned to user

### Dependency Resolution
- Uses topological sorting to determine execution order
- Checks TaskDependency records to find prerequisites
- Only executes tasks when all dependencies have Status='Complete'
- Supports both sequential and parallel execution patterns

### Data Passing
- Input payload stored with task at creation time
- At execution time, dependent task outputs are retrieved
- Payloads merged with `@taskX.output` references replaced
- Final merged payload passed to agent execution
- Agent output stored for downstream tasks

## Database Schema
**Uses existing entities - NO SCHEMA CHANGES REQUIRED**:

### TaskEntity (MJ: Tasks)
- **ID**: Task identifier
- **ConversationDetailID**: Links task to conversation
- **AgentID**: Which agent executes this task
- **Status**: 'Pending' | 'In Progress' | 'Complete' | 'Failed' | etc.
- **Description**: Stores metadata (temp solution)
- **StartedAt**: Execution start time
- **CompletedAt**: Execution end time

### TaskDependencyEntity (MJ: Task Dependencies)
- **TaskID**: Dependent task
- **DependsOnTaskID**: Prerequisite task
- **DependencyType**: 'Prerequisite' | 'Corequisite' | 'Optional'

### TaskTypeEntity (MJ: Task Types)
- Created "AI Agent Execution" type if doesn't exist

## Example Use Cases

### Example 1: Sequential Research and Report
**User Request**: "Research top 10 companies in AI, then create a competitive analysis report"

**Task Graph**:
```json
{
  "isMultiStep": true,
  "tasks": [
    {
      "tempId": "research",
      "name": "Research AI Companies",
      "agentName": "Research Agent",
      "dependsOn": [],
      "inputPayload": { "topic": "top AI companies", "limit": 10 }
    },
    {
      "tempId": "report",
      "name": "Create Competitive Analysis",
      "agentName": "Analysis Agent",
      "dependsOn": ["research"],
      "inputPayload": {
        "companies": "@research.output",
        "reportType": "competitive analysis"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Example 2: Parallel Data Gathering
**User Request**: "Get revenue data for associations AND get member counts, then create summary report"

**Task Graph**:
```json
{
  "isMultiStep": true,
  "tasks": [
    {
      "tempId": "revenue",
      "name": "Get Revenue Data",
      "agentName": "Data Agent",
      "dependsOn": [],
      "inputPayload": { "metric": "revenue" }
    },
    {
      "tempId": "members",
      "name": "Get Member Counts",
      "agentName": "Data Agent",
      "dependsOn": [],
      "inputPayload": { "metric": "member_count" }
    },
    {
      "tempId": "summary",
      "name": "Create Summary Report",
      "agentName": "Report Agent",
      "dependsOn": ["revenue", "members"],
      "inputPayload": {
        "revenueData": "@revenue.output",
        "memberData": "@members.output"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Backward Compatibility
- Existing single-agent delegation unchanged
- Conversation Manager can still return `invokeAgent` for simple requests
- Conversation Manager can still stay silent when appropriate
- New `taskGraph` response is additive, not breaking

## Testing Scenarios

### Test 1: Simple Single-Step (Regression)
- Request that should trigger single agent
- Verify Conversation Manager returns `invokeAgent`
- Verify task orchestration NOT triggered

### Test 2: Basic Sequential Tasks
- Request requiring two sequential tasks
- Verify task graph created with dependency
- Verify Task 1 executes first
- Verify Task 2 receives Task 1 output
- Verify both complete successfully

### Test 3: Parallel Tasks with Merge
- Request requiring parallel data gathering + analysis
- Verify parallel tasks execute simultaneously
- Verify final task waits for both prerequisites
- Verify outputs from both tasks merged correctly

### Test 4: Error Handling
- Request with task that will fail
- Verify dependent tasks NOT executed
- Verify error properly recorded in task
- Verify user receives meaningful error message

## Future Enhancements

### High Priority
1. Add InputPayload and OutputPayload columns to Task table (remove Description workaround)
2. Add integration to actual Conversation Manager agent response processing
3. Add progress updates via PubSub for real-time task status
4. Add task cancellation support

### Medium Priority
1. Add task retry logic for transient failures
2. Add task timeout handling
3. Add more sophisticated payload transformation (beyond simple @taskX.output)
4. Add task branching based on prior task results

### Low Priority
1. Add task scheduling (delayed execution)
2. Add task templates for common workflows
3. Add visual task graph in UI
4. Add task execution statistics and analytics
