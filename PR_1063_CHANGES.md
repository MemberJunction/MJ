# PR #1063 Changes Summary

## Addressed Concerns

### 1. ✅ Added Changeset for Version Bumping
- Created changeset file: `.changeset/integrate-metadatasync-mjcli.md`
- Includes patch version bumps for both `@memberjunction/cli` and `@memberjunction/metadata-sync` packages
- Properly documents the refactoring changes

### 2. ✅ Updated MetadataSync README Documentation
- Replaced all `mj-sync` command references with `mj sync` throughout the README
- Updated installation instructions to reference the MJCLI package
- Updated CLI command examples to use the new `mj sync` namespace
- Changed package description from "CLI tool" to "library" to reflect its new role
- Updated CI/CD integration examples to install `@memberjunction/cli` instead of `@memberjunction/metadata-sync`

### 3. ✅ Implemented SQL Logging Feature
- Created `SQLLogger` class in `src/lib/sql-logger.ts`
- Supports both raw SQL logging and migration-formatted output
- Captures SQL statements with inline parameters
- Writes logs to configurable output directory
- Integrated into PushService with initialization and log writing

### 4. ✅ Added Transaction Support
- Created `TransactionManager` class in `src/lib/transaction-manager.ts`
- Provides atomic operations for push commands
- Supports begin, commit, and rollback operations
- Integrated into PushService to wrap all entity operations in a transaction
- Includes error handling with automatic rollback

### 5. ✅ Addressed TODO Comments
- Added clear TODO comment in `processRelatedEntities` method explaining what needs to be implemented
- Added TODO comment for SQL logging integration with BaseEntity
- Made the incomplete implementation more explicit for future developers

### 6. ✅ Added Explanatory Comment for Unrelated Changes
- Added comment to `distribution.config.cjs` explaining the export was added to support the integrated MJCLI package

## Technical Implementation Details

### SQL Logging
- Configuration is loaded from root `.mj-sync.json` file
- Supports `enabled`, `outputDirectory`, and `formatAsMigration` options
- Logs are written after successful push operations
- File naming follows timestamp patterns for easy sorting

### Transaction Support
- Transactions are started before processing any entities
- Commit occurs only if all operations succeed with no errors
- Rollback happens automatically on any error
- Works with providers that support transaction methods

### Known Limitations
- SQL logging requires deeper integration with MemberJunction core to capture actual SQL statements
- Currently, the SQL statements are not captured from BaseEntity operations
- Full implementation of related entities processing is still pending

## Files Modified

2. `packages/MetadataSync/README.md` (14 updates)
3. `packages/MetadataSync/src/lib/sql-logger.ts` (new)
4. `packages/MetadataSync/src/lib/transaction-manager.ts` (new)
5. `packages/MetadataSync/src/services/PushService.ts` (updated with SQL logging and transactions)
