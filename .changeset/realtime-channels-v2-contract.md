Realtime Channels v2, first phase: a self-describing channel contract, per-agent/app/host channel scoping, a validated `ContextTool` proxy, and a lifted visual-perception pump. Existing channels, tool names and hosts are unchanged.

`minor` because the branch edits `metadata/entities/JSONType-interfaces/IAgentSettings.ts` (the new `Realtime.Channels` block); there is no migration, and no new entity column.

- **Channel descriptors** (`@memberjunction/ai-core-plus`, `@memberjunction/realtime-runtime`). `RealtimeChannelDescriptor` (nouns, verbs with parameter schemas and `InvokableBy`, events, inputs/output, display policy, default availability, exposure ceiling) and the new `BaseRealtimeChannelClient` members `GetDescriptor`, `GetState`, `ApplyVerb`, `Events$`, `Output$`, `Open`, `Complete`, `InstanceId`. A channel that implements only the original members is synthesized a descriptor, so nothing changes for it. The Whiteboard, Remote Browser, Media and Client Context channels ship authored descriptors; their native tool names are unchanged. Perception notes are structured and debounced (`[channel:<Key>#<instance>] state_changed {…}`, a snapshot first and then deltas).
- **Channel scoping.** Code default, then agent (`realtime.channels` in the configuration cascade), then app (`Application.AgentSettings.Realtime.Channels`), then host-declared channels (`StartRealtimeSession(…, { HostChannels })`, which work on connect-only providers with no registry rows). `IsActive = false` on a registry row remains a master kill switch. At mint the browser reports its candidates (`channelCandidatesJson`) and the server returns the resolved policy (`ClientPolicyJson`), narrows the declared tools to match, persists the in-scope channel keys on the session, and drops the excluded channels' server plugins. A client with no server policy resolves the same scope locally, and a client against an older server falls back to the original mint mutation.
- **`ContextTool` proxy.** Accepts `target: { channel, instance? }`; a targeted call is validated against the addressed verb's parameter schema and returns a structured, model-recoverable error on failure. `on-demand` channels are opened mid-session with `action: "open"`. A catalog note rendered from the descriptors tells the model which channels exist.
- **App client tools.** `Application.AgentSettings.ClientTools` is now read by the realtime path and resolved through `ResolveClientTools`. `RegisterAppClientTools(tools, owner?)` is owner-keyed (new `UnregisterAppClientTools` / `ClearAppClientTools`); Explorer registers its globals and the active surface under separate owners and clears the previous app's surface tools on an app switch (previously they lingered). `FormatClientToolsForPrompt` is removed: it never had a caller.
- **Visual perception.** The Whiteboard's change-driven frame pump now lives in the base channel (`EnableVisualPerception`); frames are tagged with the change id of the state they describe. The Whiteboard's behavior is unchanged.
- **Session config rewrites no longer drop fields.** `RealtimeClientSessionResolver` rebuilt the persisted session config field by field on the run-id and pending-feedback rewrites, dropping `mediaCollectionID` and `directActions`; it now carries the existing config forward.
