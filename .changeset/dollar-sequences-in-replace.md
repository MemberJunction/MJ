Fix `$`-sequence corruption in `String.prototype.replace` calls carrying runtime data (#3171).

`replace(search, replacement)` treats `$$`, `$&`, `` $` ``, `$'` and `$1`–`$99` as metacharacters when `replacement` is a **string**. Every site below passed runtime data there, so a `$` in that data was silently executed rather than inserted. The `$&`/`` $` ``/`$'` forms are worse than value corruption: they splice surrounding text *into* the value. All are fixed by passing a replacement **function**, whose return value is used literally.

- **`@memberjunction/installer` — corrupted secrets (highest impact).** Re-running `mj install` syncs the root `.env` into MJAPI's. A DB password containing `$&` had the *stale* MJAPI password spliced into it; ``$` `` spliced in the preceding `.env` line. The result was a wrong secret written to disk with no error, surfacing later as "MJAPI can't connect". Only the replace branch was affected — fresh installs (append branch, string concatenation) were always correct, which is why this survived. Also fixes the `newUserSetup` block (embeds user name/email) and the `mjRepoVersion` and Explorer `environment.ts` patchers.
- **`@memberjunction/core` — rewritten RLS predicates.** `RowLevelSecurityFilterInfo.MarkupFilterText` substitutes user properties, magic-link scope and `{{Acting*}}` tokens into row-level-security filters. A `$` in any of them rewrote the predicate — the exact outcome the neighbouring `'`-escaping exists to prevent. This feeds `GetEffectiveRowFilterWhereClause`, used across RunView reads, Create and Update. Also fixes organic-key `Custom` normalization, which builds a SQL `WHERE` from a data value.
- **`@memberjunction/generic-database-provider`, `@memberjunction/postgresql-dataprovider`** — end-user search terms substituted into `UserSearchParamFormatAPI` predicates, plus view-template inner SQL and PG identifier quoting. Also `QueryCompositionEngine.renameSQLIdentifier`, which rewrites CTE identifiers in composed queries: the search side was regex-escaped but the replacement side was not, so a `$` in a deconflicted CTE name (SQL Server bracketed and PG quoted identifiers both permit one) was expanded into the executed SQL.
- **`@memberjunction/ai-prompts`, `@memberjunction/computer-use`, `@memberjunction/ai-vector-sync`, `@memberjunction/aiengine`, `@memberjunction/ai-agents`** — assistant prefill text (routinely contains `$$` for LaTeX or currency), computer-use goals/URLs/step summaries, embedding-document field values, and entity field values, all interpolated into prompts and templates.
- **`@memberjunction/metadata-sync`** — parameter values in the debug SQL log.
- **`@memberjunction/testing-engine`** — test input/expected/actual values into the LLM-judge prompt, and parameter values into `SQLValidatorOracle`'s generated SQL.
- **`@memberjunction/sql-converter`** — the configured schema name substituted into emitted PostgreSQL view SQL, in both `ViewRule` and its previously-missed twin in `InsertRule`. The schema is now escaped on the *search* side too: a `$` in it acted as an end-anchor, so the pattern matched nothing and the conversion silently emitted no rewrite.
- **`@memberjunction/sql-parser`** — `restoreAliases` swaps generated aliases back to the caller's original bracketed identifiers. Two of its three branches used `split`/`join` and were already safe; the third expanded `$`-sequences, so `[a$'b]` spliced surrounding SQL into an identifier. The aliasing path fires precisely *because* an identifier contains a non-word character, so the input that triggers aliasing is the input that corrupted the restore. Reached from the public `ToSQL()`.
- **`@memberjunction/sqlserver-dataprovider`** — batch execution rewrites `@name` placeholders to `@q<N>_name`; the parameter name went into the `RegExp` unescaped, so a `$` in it prevented the rewrite entirely and mssql failed with "Must declare the scalar variable". Sibling of the PostgreSQL `escapeRegExp` fix below.
- **`@memberjunction/react-linter`** — component data substituted into diagnostic messages.
- **`@memberjunction/actions-bizapps-social`, `@memberjunction/ai-cli`** — hardened a numeric-only site; documented the AICLI JSON highlighter's `$1` back-references as intentional.

Also fixes a **test-tooling safety defect** found while verifying the above on a clean database: `@memberjunction/testing-cli` loaded `.env` with `dotenv.config({ override: true })`, so a variable already set in the environment was overwritten. `DB_DATABASE=MJ_scratch mj test …` was silently discarded and the suite ran — **including mutation tests** — against whatever `.env` pointed at. That made the "one database per agent" rule unenforceable by environment variable and diverged from every other `mj` command (`migrate`, `codegen`, `sync push` all honour the environment). `override` is now dotenv's default `false`, so `.env` still fills in anything unset but an explicit value wins. Guarded by a unit test.

And an adjacent defect found while testing the above: `PostgreSQLDataProvider.quoteFieldNamesInToken` interpolated a field name into a `RegExp` **without escaping regex metacharacters**, so a column named `a.b` matched (and wrongly quoted) unrelated text like `axb`, and a column containing `$` was never matched at all — which had also made the replacement-side fix on that line unreachable. Field names are now escaped before interpolation.

Also adds `.github/scripts/check-dynamic-replace.mjs`, a CI gate that flags `.replace()`/`.replaceAll()` whose replacement is neither a string literal nor a function. No existing lint rule covered this — the React `string-replace-all-occurrences` rule only ever inspects the *search* argument. The gate is line-aware (only lines a change touches), since ~100 pre-existing sites remain and a bare identifier holding a function reference is indistinguishable from one holding a string; `--all` is available for auditing. Regression tests now push `$$`, `$&`, `` $` ``, `$'` and `$1` through each fixed path.
