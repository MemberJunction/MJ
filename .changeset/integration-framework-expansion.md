feat(integration): Integration Framework Expansion — schema + metadata-driven CRUD base class, generated layer, cross-dialect hardening, and field-mapping cache

End-to-end increment expanding the integration framework: new per-operation write metadata on the schema, a generic metadata-driven CRUD base class, the regenerated entity/GraphQL/form layers that expose it, plus the cross-dialect (PostgreSQL + SQL Server) bug fixes and a field-mapping performance cache found while proving it live.

**Schema (v5.39.x migration)**

- `IntegrationObject`: explicit per-operation write columns — `CreateAPIPath`/`Method`/`BodyShape`/`BodyKey`/`IDLocation`, `UpdateAPIPath`/`Method`/`BodyShape`/`BodyKey`/`IDLocation`, `DeleteAPIPath`/`DeleteIDLocation`. The legacy `WriteAPIPath`/`WriteMethod` are kept one release as deprecated aliases.
- `IntegrationObject`: `IncrementalWatermarkField` — vendor cursor/timestamp field name driving the incremental sync filter.
- `IntegrationObject` + `IntegrationObjectField`: `MetadataSource` enum `{Declared, Discovered, Custom}` — provenance for merge precedence in `IntegrationSchemaSync`.

All schema changes are additive (new nullable fields + a new enum field) — no existing field is removed, renamed, or narrowed — so the bumps are **minor**.

**Engine / base class (`@memberjunction/integration-engine`)**

- `ExternalFieldSchema`: add `IsPrimaryKey` (distinct from `IsUniqueKey`). Fixes an `IntrospectSchema` bug where `IsPrimaryKey` was incorrectly mapped from `IsUniqueKey` — an object can have multiple unique fields but only one primary key.
- `BaseRESTIntegrationConnector`: new `TransformRecord` hook — optional per-record customization seam between `NormalizeResponse` and `ToExternalRecord` (default identity); override for vendor-specific record-level shape changes.
- `BaseRESTIntegrationConnector`: generic metadata-driven CRUD — `CreateRecord`/`UpdateRecord`/`DeleteRecord`/`GetRecord` read the per-operation columns and execute generically. Concrete connectors override only when an API is genuinely idiosyncratic. Replaces the hand-rolled write logic previously duplicated across every concrete connector.
- `FieldMappingEngine`: cache compiled `custom`-transform expressions instead of recompiling `new Function` once per field per record. A batch of N records sharing an expression compiles it once and executes the cached function N times, dropping per-record cost from `O(compile + execute)` to `O(execute)`. The cache stores a typed `CompiledExpression = (value, fields) => unknown` (no weak typing), caches compile failures too (a malformed expression is compiled once and the resulting `Error` re-thrown from cache per record, leaving `OnError` `Fail`/`Null`/`Skip` semantics unchanged), and is bounded by `MJLruCache` (1000-entry default) since the owning `IntegrationEngine` is a process-lifetime singleton.

**Generated layer (CodeGen for the v5.39.x migration)**

- `@memberjunction/core-entities` — `IntegrationObjectEntity` / `IntegrationObjectFieldEntity` gain strongly-typed accessors for the per-operation write columns, `IncrementalWatermarkField`, and the `MetadataSource` enum (`'Declared' | 'Discovered' | 'Custom'`).
- `@memberjunction/server` — regenerated resolvers / GraphQL types expose the new fields.
- `@memberjunction/ng-core-entity-forms` — regenerated `MJ: Integration Objects` / `MJ: Integration Object Fields` forms render the new fields.

**Cross-dialect hardening (PostgreSQL + SQL Server)**

Bugs found and fixed while proving the framework end-to-end on both dialects with live generated actions:

- `@memberjunction/codegen-lib` — PostgreSQL CRUD generation emitted the primary-key column twice for composite-PK entities, so association/junction tables never synced on PG; `PostgreSQLCodeGenProvider` now treats a multi-column PK as strategy-handled. Soft-PK/FK application uses dialect-aware identifier quoting and boolean literals (`this.dialect.QuoteIdentifier` / `BooleanLiteral`) so the pass runs correctly on PostgreSQL.
- `@memberjunction/server` — wired the PostgreSQL branch of the in-process CodeGen runner (`RuntimeSchemaManager.SetCodeGenRunner`) that previously existed only for SQL Server, so runtime schema sync no longer falls back to a hang-prone child process on PG. `IntegrationDiscoveryResolver` entity/field-map creation is now create-or-reuse (idempotent on re-apply), and its idempotency + operational list reads use `BypassCache` so create-vs-update decisions read committed state.
- `@memberjunction/integration-engine` — `MatchEngine.FindRecordMapEntry` and the bulk record-map load now read committed state (`BypassCache`), fixing duplicate-create after a direct-DB change; watermark save/load is idempotent to avoid a transaction-abort on retry. `LoadRunConfiguration` and every remaining operational decision-read — the upsert-by-identity record-map lookup, field-maps, the full-vs-incremental gate, write-back external-id lookup, orphan-sweep, and orphaned-run resume — now also `BypassCache`. This closes a Postgres-only gap where a freshly-toggled entity-map `Configuration` (e.g. enabling partition/Merkle reconcile) was read stale → the ChangeToken rollup was silently never written on PG, and removes the broader read-stale-then-decide bug class so the read-your-own-writes pipeline always decides from committed state on both dialects.
- `@memberjunction/core-actions` — the generated integration-action executor used stale entity names (`'Integrations'`, `'Company Integrations'`); corrected to `'MJ: Integrations'` / `'MJ: Company Integrations'` so `List`/`Get` invoke successfully.
- `@memberjunction/core-entities-server` — declares its previously-undeclared `@memberjunction/integration-pk-classifier` dependency (used by the server-side LLM PK-detection callback), fixing the missing-dependency check; covers the integration server-entity behavior (`MJCompanyIntegrationEntityServer`, `IntegrationLLMPKCallback`).
- Multi-provider safety — the post-pipeline metadata `Refresh()` calls in `IntegrationDiscoveryResolver` and `MJCompanyIntegrationEntityServer` now refresh the request's own provider (`provider ?? new Metadata()`) instead of the global default, satisfying the `MultiProviderCompliance` gate and refreshing the correct cache under a non-default provider.
- Dialect layer (`@memberjunction/sql-dialect`) — statement splitting for runtime schema migrations is now a dialect concern: `SplitStatements` (naive `;`-split on the base, dollar-quote-aware override on PostgreSQL so `DO $$…$$` blocks stay intact) instead of living in the schema-engine runtime.
