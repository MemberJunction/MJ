Add `@memberjunction/ai-bridge-livekit-native` — the real native LiveKit room client that wraps `@livekit/rtc-node` behind the `NativeRoomModule` contract `LiveKitNativeMeetingSdk` expects, giving the agent two-way audio (publish the agent's voice + subscribe to per-participant audio for diarized hearing) in a live LiveKit room. `@livekit/rtc-node` is an optionalDependency loaded lazily, so the package builds/tests with no addon (fake-module tests). Also regenerates the pre-built class-registration manifests to include `LoopbackBridge` from `@memberjunction/ai-bridge-server`.
