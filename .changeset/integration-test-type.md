Add the **"Integration Test" `TestType`** — a headless, metadata-driven integration tier that runs the real MJ provider stack (live SQL Server / GraphQL, real cache managers + engines, real entity saves; no browser, no mocks) inside the Testing Framework, focused first on cache-integrity. The standalone `tsx` cache suites in `packages/MJServer/integration-test-scripts/` are graduated into first-class check bundles on one shared registry, so the same definitions run identically via the `npm run test:integration` aggregator **and** via `mj test` / `TestRun` (the `IntegrationTestDriver`) — a single source of truth.

**New package `@memberjunction/testing-integration`.** Dedicated-process bootstrap that installs an instrumented `LocalCacheManager` as the first caller (`bootstrapIntegrationServer` / `bootstrapIntegrationClient` / `installInstrumentedCacheFirst`, gated by `MJ_INTEGRATION_TEST=1`); the `IntegrationCheckRegistry` + `NamedCheck` contract; the `InstrumentedLocalStorageProvider` / `UniqueFilter` / `TestRunner` / `ai-verify` proof primitives; and the `IntegrationTestDriver` (`@RegisterClass(BaseTestDriver, 'IntegrationTestDriver')`), which dispatches a Test's configured bundles against one bootstrapped context and maps each check to an `OracleResult`. `@memberjunction/testing-cli`'s run/suite commands install the instrumented cache first under `MJ_INTEGRATION_TEST=1` (byte-for-byte unchanged otherwise); the old `lib/harness.ts` becomes a thin re-export shim.

**Graduated check bundles (single source of truth).** Every standalone suite is now a thin dispatcher of a registry bundle with a metadata `Test` record (IT01–IT19) joined to an "Integration Tests" suite:
- **Deterministic server:** `server-cache` (S1–S31), `runquery-cache`, `dataset-cache`, `aggregates-cache` (AGG1–3), `record-process`, `record-process-facade`, `scheduled-jobs`, `field-rules-bulk-update`, `remote-operations`, `ai-skills`, `api-keys`, `predictive-studio` seams, and `rls-isolation` (RLS1–RLS10 — the two overlapping RLS implementations were merged into one canonical bundle).
- **Deterministic client** (needs a live MJAPI; skips cleanly otherwise): `remote-op-wire-progress`.
- **Live-model** (`RUN_AGENT_TESTS`): `prompt-runner`, `agent-runner`, `concurrent`, `remote-op-ai-authoring`.

**Tiering & gating.** A single tier model (`tiers.ts`: `deterministic` | `mutation` | `live-model`, with `IsTierEnabled()` reading `RUN_MUTATION_TESTS` / `RUN_AGENT_TESTS`) is honored identically by the aggregator and the driver, so a flag skip-passes the same way on both paths.

**Engine-level fixture lifecycle.** A per-bundle `BundleLifecycle` (Setup → run → Teardown in FK-safe order) plus suite-scoped `SuiteFixtureContext` (`@memberjunction/testing-engine-base`) with additive `BaseTestDriver.SetupSuite()` / `TeardownSuite()` hooks; `TestEngine.RunSuite` guarantees teardown + run-status update in a `finally` (pass / fail / thrown `Execute` / timeout), and a thrown `Execute` now resolves to a `Status='Error'` `TestRun` instead of wedging `'Running'`. Mutating suites self-clean identically on both front-ends.

**RLS / multi-user cache isolation.** New version-controlled seed metadata (`metadata/roles` + `entity-permissions` + `users`): a purpose-built **"Integration Test: RLS Scoped Reader"** role (scoped read on `MJ: AI Agent Runs` via `UserID = '{{UserID}}'` and nothing else) plus three inert, login-less test accounts, so the strongest RLS checks (fingerprint divergence / server-superset no-cross-serve / live no-leak) **execute for real** instead of skipping on an admin-only DB. Accounts are `Type='User'`, no auth linkage, clearly named, safe to delete.

**Dashboard legibility.** The custom `MJ: Test Runs` form's `getCheckResults()` now reads `ResultDetails` as the bare `OracleResult[]` the engine actually writes (fixing per-check rendering for all engine runs; mapping extracted into an Angular-free, unit-tested `test-run-checks.ts`), and the runs view binds `<mj-execution-context>` to the run's machine/CI fields. The Test Run dialog's "Execution Failed" banner no longer renders empty — a `failureMessage` getter falls back through top-level `errorMessage` → a synthesized per-test summary → the single test's message → a generic note (applies to every TestType).

**CI / release gate.** New `run-all.ts` aggregator + root `npm run test:integration` spawn each deterministic server suite in its own process (so each owns `LocalCacheManager.Initialize` as first caller) and collapse the per-suite `0/1/2` exit codes into one. The deterministic SQL Server tier is a blocking PR gate.

**Cross-platform & cross-server seams.** `DbConfig` gains a `Platform` field (`DB_PLATFORM` ∈ {sqlserver, postgresql}, default sqlserver) and `bootstrapIntegrationServer` dispatches accordingly (the PG path ships behind the tracked PG user-cache prerequisite; no PG CI lane yet). A `RUN_CROSS_SERVER=1` spec proves a `Save()` in one MJAPI invalidates a cached read in a second sharing one DB + Redis.

**RunView cache-layer fixes (`@memberjunction/core`).** Three real bugs the new suites surfaced, fixed in `localCacheManager.ts` + `providerBase.ts`:
- **SECURITY:** the cache-hit path returned *before* the DB provider's read-permission gate, so a user lacking `CanRead` could be served rows a permitted user had warmed (an observed cross-user data leak). `PreRunView` and the `RunViews` batch now skip the cache when the user lacks read permission on the entity, falling through to the DB path's proper denial (server-cache S31).
- **`IgnoreMaxRows`** now participates in the RunView cache fingerprint, so an `IgnoreMaxRows` request no longer collides with (and is served) the capped slot for the same entity. Appended only when true → existing fingerprints stay byte-identical, no cache invalidation (server-cache S28).
- **`AggregateResults`** are remapped to the caller's requested order on a cache hit; the aggregate fingerprint is order-insensitive by design, so a reordered request must not inherit the warming caller's order (aggregates-cache AGG3).

All changes are additive / back-compat. Verified live against `mj_integrations` via both the `tsx` scripts and the `IntegrationTestDriver` (server-cache 26/26, aggregates-cache 3/3, rls-isolation 9/9; MJCore unit tests 1467/1467); golden-equivalence (`scripts/integration-golden-diff.mjs`) enforces no coverage loss between the two front-ends.
