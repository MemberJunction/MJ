feat(skip-types): Enhance ComponentSpec types with comprehensive requirements support

- Enhanced ComponentSpec interface with new optional properties:
  - `functionalRequirements`: Documents business requirements and user stories
  - `dataRequirements`: Specifies data sources, schemas, and integration needs
  - `technicalDesign`: Provides implementation details and architecture decisions

- Added supporting type definitions:
  - `FunctionalRequirements`: Includes goals, user stories, acceptance criteria, and edge cases
  - `DataRequirements`: Covers data sources, schemas, transformations, and validation rules
  - `TechnicalDesign`: Contains architecture details, implementation notes, dependencies, and performance considerations

These enhancements support better documentation of component requirements and design decisions, enable structured metadata for automated tooling and code generation, and facilitate collaboration between designers, developers, and stakeholders while supporting AI-assisted development with clear, structured requirements.

All changes are backward compatible as all new properties are optional.
