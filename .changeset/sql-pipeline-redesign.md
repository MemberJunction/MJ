SQL pipeline redesign. Stored queries are now written in a specified language, the MJ Query language (`guides/MJ_QUERY_LANGUAGE.md`), which is checked when a query is saved and before every render. Queries are rendered, then composed, behind a lexer-based safety gate, with per-request dialects, paging, materialized reads and field-level security applied to the rendered statement. A query's fields, parameters and entities now come from the database server's description of the query and from MJ's template parser, and any saved query can be refreshed on demand with `mj query refresh`, the `Query.RefreshExtraction` remote operation, or "Refresh metadata" in Explorer.

### New features

**SQL parsing and dialects** (`@memberjunction/sql-parser`, `@memberjunction/sql-dialect`). SQL dialects are split into facets, and query-only dialects cover external data sources. `@memberjunction/sql-parser` gains a dialect-aware lexer (`SqlTokens`), `QueryTemplate` (the MJ Query language parser and save-time checks), the tolerant structural parser `SqlDocument` with its analyses, `EditSet` transforms that edit the SQL as written instead of regenerating it, and `StrictFragmentValidator`, the fail-closed screen for caller-supplied SQL fragments. The language includes `<name>.length` (`{% if Codes and Codes.length > 0 %}`) and the inline if (`{{ MaxRows | sqlNumber if MaxRows else 12 }}`), which many stored queries use; any other attribute access is refused.

**Query metadata in the schema** (`@memberjunction/core-entities`). The schema records what the database server reports about a query's output: `QueryField` gains `SourceEntityFieldID` (linked to the entity field, cleared when that field is deleted), `IsNullable` and `SourceObjectName`, and `DetectionMethod` allows `Database` and `Parser`; `Query` gains `ExtractedSQLHash`, `ExtractionStatus` (`OK`, `Warning`, `Error`, `Skipped`) and `ExtractionMessage`. `MJ: Queries` declares `Parameters`, `Fields` and `Entities` collections, so a query and the child rows it declares save as one graph, and declared rows win over extraction for the same name. Query field nullability and source entity field are part of a query's definition signature.

**Metadata sync** (`@memberjunction/metadata-sync`). `mj sync push` saves `relatedEntities` groups through a parent's declared collection, in the parent's graph save, and `mj sync pull` writes new records in the `collections` format. The `relatedEntities` file format keeps working.

**Extraction on save** (`@memberjunction/core-entities-server`, `@memberjunction/server`). Saving a new or edited query extracts its metadata from the database server's description of the query (the base render and one render per `{% if %}` branch) and from MJ's template parser: output fields with exact types, nullability and their source entity field, parameters with composition pass-throughs, the entities it reads (`DetectionMethod` `Parser` on parameters and entity links), and its dependencies. Facts are corrected on every row; authored annotations (descriptions, a `Manual` parameter's type, default, sample and filters) are kept. Doc comments (`{# @param / @field #}`, trailing `--:`) count as authored, and an authored parameter the SQL no longer uses is kept and flagged. `UsesTemplate` comes from the lexer, and `ExtractedSQLHash`, `ExtractionStatus` and `ExtractionMessage` record each run: external-data-source queries are `Skipped`, and a describe failure is an `Error` that keeps the stored rows. The derived rows are written as the system user, and the LLM only fills empty descriptions after the save commits (skipped with `SkipEntityAIActions`). `MJQueryEntityServer.ExtractionOverride` (`Auto` / `Skip` / `Force`) controls extraction per save, and `SkipEmbeddings` is honoured. A query that reads a table named by a template parameter (the External Change Detection queries) keeps its declared fields instead of describing a sample table.

**Refresh without changing SQL** (`@memberjunction/core-entities-server`, `@memberjunction/cli`, `@memberjunction/codegen-lib`). `QueryExtractionService` (`RefreshQuery`, `RefreshQueries` by ID, name or full path, category path, entity read, or all) runs the same extraction a save runs: one transaction per query, the queries a composition depends on first, a dry run that reports the changes without writing, and an optional LLM description pass. Each query gets a report: its outcome, the child rows added, updated and removed, flagged parameters and the run's diagnostics. The entry points are the `Query.RefreshExtraction` remote operation (long-running with progress; API keys need the new `query:refresh` scope), `mj query refresh [--id|--name|--category|--entity|--all] [--dry-run] [--with-ai] [--format text|json]`, and a CodeGen pass that re-binds the queries reading an entity whose fields were added, dropped or changed type. That pass records a query the change broke as an `Error` with the server's message, and warns when a query authorized by its role list gains a field-restricted column.

**Explorer** (`@memberjunction/ng-core-entity-forms`, `@memberjunction/ng-query-viewer`, `@memberjunction/ng-dashboards`, `@memberjunction/ng-artifacts`, `@memberjunction/ng-code-editor`). The query form saves the query with its parameters, fields and entity links as one graph save; a refused save lists each finding with its rule code, line, column and fix, and marks it in the SQL editor (`<mj-code-editor>` gains `SetDiagnosticMarkers` and `RevealPosition`). The form shows the extraction status and message, and its field and parameter grids show how each row was detected, nullability and the source entity field (as a link) or server-reported object; facts are read-only and annotations editable. "Refresh metadata" in the form and in the Query Browser (the selected query, a category, or all) always runs a dry run first, shows live progress and a per-query report with change counts and a drill-in, then applies on request; a user setting skips the dry run for single-query refreshes. The save-query dialog, the data artifact's "update query" and the Query Browser editor show the server's findings instead of a generic failure; findings travel as text lines read with `ParseQuerySaveMessage` / `ParseQueryDiagnostics`.

### Improvements

- **Shipped queries declare their metadata** (`metadata/queries`). Every shipped query declares its parameters and output fields, with field facts taken from the database server's description; primary keys reuse the IDs earlier releases gave the rows. `GetAgentRunTree` filters its parameters, the composition demo names its targets by full path, and 17 shipped queries gain PostgreSQL variants.
- **External Change Detection queries take server-set values** (`@memberjunction/external-change-detection`). Every value is a server-set parameter, identifiers are quoted with `sqlIdentifier`, and `ChangeDetector` passes them as `ServerParameters`.
- **Extraction reads the database, not the cache** (`@memberjunction/core-entities-server`). A query's stored child rows are read from the database on the save's transaction, so a dialect variant saved in the same push no longer overwrites them, and extraction uses the saving provider's platform.
- **Materialized reads bind typed, named parameters** (`@memberjunction/generic-database-provider`), typed from the snapshot table's columns, so the database can use its indexes. Rows are unchanged.
- **Paging and materialization edit the SQL as written** (`@memberjunction/generic-database-provider`, `@memberjunction/materialization`, `@memberjunction/codegen-lib`). Row caps, ORDER BY removal and CTE hoisting no longer regenerate the statement, so `CountSQL`, the persisted materialization `BroadSQL` and `StripTopLevelOrderBy` output keep the author's text; a `WITH`-headed source no longer lands inside a derived table, and a dependency's ORDER BY under TOP is kept.

### Bug fixes

- **`CreateQueryExtended` with `AutoResolveCollision` gives every concurrent request its own query** (#6007), and its existence checks read the database uncached. `CreateQueryExtended` / `UpdateQueryExtended` return every column of the child rows.
- **Composed queries render correctly in cases that failed before**: doubled quotes in composed string arguments, `NaN` from untyped arithmetic, a query starting with `;`, and a caller's `null` reaching a composing query's template (`default(…)` now applies).
- **Extraction fixes**: a refresh reports and writes a field whose nullability changed between unknown and known; an outer parameter read only by an arithmetic composition argument takes the number type of the parameter it feeds; describe renders give untyped and array parameters numeric samples; describing a statement with a leading or trailing `;` works on PostgreSQL; `MJQueryEntityServer` saved through a network provider leaves extraction to the server; doc-comment continuation lines lose their alignment spaces.
- **Multiple row-level security filters are grouped in parentheses** (#4078) by `EntityInfo.GetUserRowLevelSecurityWhereClause`, so an `OR` between two filters no longer escapes the surrounding condition.
- **The legacy extractors stop reporting phantom tables**: `ExtractTableRefs` / `Parse().Tables` no longer return CTE names, read nothing from comments or string literals, and no longer invent a `dbo` schema on PostgreSQL; `ExtractSelectColumns` / `ExtractColumnRefs` return results for SQL node-sql-parser rejects; `ExtractCTEs` returns each CTE's exact source text.

### Upgrade Notes

**Run a query refresh after upgrading.** Two migrations apply on `mj migrate` (`Query_Extraction_Metadata` and `Query_Child_Detection_Methods`). After migrating, refresh every saved query so its fields, parameters, entities and extraction columns are established from its SQL and the database server:

```bash
mj query refresh --all --dry-run   # review: writes nothing
mj query refresh --all             # apply
```

- The dry run lists each query as would-refresh or unchanged, with the field, parameter and entity rows it would add, update or remove, and its diagnostics. `--verbose` also lists unchanged queries; `--format json` gives a machine-readable report.
- Expect most queries to show corrected field facts: exact types where a placeholder such as `decimal(18,2)` was stored, nullability, a linked source entity field, missing columns added, and columns collected from inside a CTE removed. Field descriptions and other authored values are kept.
- The real run writes those rows and sets each query's `ExtractionStatus` (`OK`, `Warning`, `Error` or `Skipped`) and `ExtractionMessage`. It never changes a query's SQL. A dry run afterwards should report every query unchanged.
- `mj query refresh` runs in process as the system user. A refresh started from Explorer or the `Query.RefreshExtraction` remote operation needs Update on `MJ: Queries`, Create/Update/Delete on `MJ: Query Fields`, `MJ: Query Parameters`, `MJ: Query Entities` and `MJ: Query Dependencies`, and read access to the entities the queries read; queries the caller may not refresh are reported as not permitted and left alone. The command exits non-zero when a query fails, or when a query named with `--id` or `--name` cannot be refreshed.
- Client query caches miss once after the upgrade, because a query's definition signature now includes its field facts.

**Saved queries to review after the refresh.** These kinds of existing queries may report `Warning` or `Error`. Unless noted, they keep running as before, but a save that changes their SQL is refused until it is fixed; the message names the rule and the fix (`guides/MJ_QUERY_LANGUAGE.md` lists every rule, and which ones also stop a run).

- A query that composes another query and relies on a same-named parameter flowing into it without passing it: `Warning` (`MJQ_COMPOSITION_IMPLICIT_ARGUMENT`), **and its results change** (see below).
- A template tag inside a string literal or quoted identifier (`'{{ x }}'`, `[{{ x }}]`).
- A string, array or date value written into the SQL without an MJ SQL filter (`sqlString`, `sqlIn`, `sqlDate`, …), unless the parameter is server-set.
- A composition reference whose category path is partial or wrong, or a composition outside a FROM / JOIN table position.
- Two output columns with the same name (compared case-insensitively).
- Arithmetic inside `{{ }}`, a non-literal `default(…)`, or a filter that does not match the parameter's type.
- Template syntax outside the language: macros, includes, function calls, an unknown filter or `Context.*` token, member access other than `.length`, or a composition reference that names no existing query: **refused at run time**, because the template is checked before it is rendered. The dry run shows these as `Error`.
- A query that writes, runs more than one statement, starts with `SET` / `DECLARE`, or calls a function the dialect forbids: **refused at run time** as well as at save.
- A query whose SQL no longer runs against the current schema (a dropped or renamed column): `Error`, with the database server's message; its stored rows are kept.
- A query against an external data source: `Skipped` (it is not described).

**Behaviour changes.**

- **Composition arguments must be listed explicitly.** A composed query only receives the arguments written in its reference, as in `{{query:"Path/Name(StartDate=StartDate)"}}`. An inner parameter that is not passed is absent (its `{% if %}` blocks are false), even when the outer query has a parameter of the same name. Before, same-named values could flow in by accident. A query that relied on that now returns the inner query's unfiltered rows; add the arguments to its reference. An unpassed *required* parameter is an error, and a composed query's required parameters are now checked at run time.
- **Composition lookup needs the category path.** The name-only fallback is gone. A new or edited query must give the full path; at run time an existing query whose partial path matches exactly one query still runs, and a warning is logged.
- **New save-time refusals.** A new or edited query that breaks a rule of the MJ Query language, writes, or repeats an output column name is not saved: `Save()` fails, and `CreateQueryExtended` / `UpdateQueryExtended` return `Success: false` with each finding (rule code, line, column, fix). Agents and tools that create queries must handle the refusal. Existing queries keep running unless they use syntax outside the language (listed above); the refresh reports them.
- **`.length` and the inline if are supported.** `{% if Codes and Codes.length > 0 %}` and `{{ X | sqlNumber if X else 12 }}` keep working; no other member access is allowed.
- **Field-level security applies to queries.** A query is checked against the running user's field permissions on the rendered statement. When the query names a field the user may not read, the run is refused with the same message as a query that does not exist (`Query 'X' does not exist or you do not have permission to run it.`), so code that matched the old "Denied entities" text must change. A restricted field reached only through `SELECT *` or `alias.*` is dropped from that user's results instead of refusing the query, so result columns can differ per user. Queries authorized through Query Permissions (definer's rights) are unchanged. The Explorer grid builds its columns from the result, so a dropped column never appears.
- **Extraction no longer overwrites what people wrote.** A parameter's authored type, required flag, default, sample and description are kept, and `DetectionMethod` is no longer forced to `AI`. Field facts (name, order, type, nullability, source, computed flag) follow the database server, and `SourceFieldName` is always the real entity field name, never the output alias. The LLM writes descriptions only, after the save commits, so descriptions are not yet present in the `CreateQueryExtended` result.
- **`UsesTemplate` is a fact about the SQL.** A failed extraction no longer sets it to `false`, and a query with template syntax is rendered whatever the stored flag says.
- **Rendering uses the request's dialect.** Template filters follow the provider that runs the query, not a process-wide platform, so one process can serve SQL Server and PostgreSQL providers.
- **Composed SQL text differs.** `RenderedSQL`, `RenderResult.FinalSQL` and the paging `CountSQL` keep the same columns and rows but may differ in CTE names and whitespace, and a branch not taken emits no CTE. In `RenderResult.Trace`, `AfterComposition` and `AfterTemplates` both hold the assembled SQL, because templates are now rendered before composition. CodeGen may rewrite persisted `BroadSQL` text on its next run.
- **The query form saves child rows with the query.** In Explorer, adding a parameter or field is saved when the query is saved, not immediately.
- **Legacy extractor results change** as listed under Bug fixes: callers that subtracted CTE names keep working, code that expected them, or compared `SchemaName` with `'dbo'` to mean "unqualified", should be checked. `ExtractTemplateExpressions`, `ExtractCompositionRefs` and `ExtractParameterInfo` no longer report tags written inside SQL comments; `Tokenize` is unchanged.

**Deprecations.** These keep working, unchanged, through 6.x and are removed no earlier than 7.0. Each JSDoc names its replacement.

- `SQLParser` (`@memberjunction/sql-parser`), static and instance members: read SQL with `SqlDocument.Parse(sql, dialect)` (`TableReferences()`, `ColumnReferences()`, `OutputItems()`, `CTEs()`, `TopLevelOrderBy()`, `RowCaps()`, `StatementKinds()`, `HasStackedStatements()`), read templates with `QueryTemplate.Parse(sql, dialect)` (`Parameters()`, `CompositionReferences()`, its nodes), and change SQL with `EditSet` and the transforms (`StripOrderBy`, `SetRowCap`, `ReplaceSelectList`, `AppendTail`, `HoistCTEs`, `RenameCTE`, `WrapAsDerivedTable`). `Astify`, `ParseSQL`, `SqlifyAST`, `WalkAST` and the node-sql-parser AST stay for callers that walk that tree.
- `SQLParser.HasWriteStatement` must not be used to decide whether SQL is safe to run (it returns false when it cannot parse). Use `IsReadOnlyQuery`, `SqlDocument.IsReadOnly()`, or `StrictFragmentValidator.ValidateReadOnlyStatement` for untrusted SQL.
- `LexSQL`, `SignificantTokens`, `IsKeyword` → `SqlTokens.Lex(sql, dialect)`; `SplitLeadingCTEs` → `SqlDocument.CTEs()` or `HoistCTEs`; `AnalyzePagingShape` → `SqlDocument` analyses and the transforms; `AnalyzeTopLevelOrderBy`, `HasTopLevelOrderBy`, `ExtractOrderBy`, `FindOrderByStatement`, `IsOrderByLegalInCTE` → `SqlDocument.TopLevelOrderBy()` and `StripOrderBy`; `ParseToIR` / `RenderIR` → `QueryTemplate` and `EditSet`; `CheckAggregateExpression` → `StrictFragmentValidator.ValidateAggregateExpression`. `IsReadOnlyQuery` is not deprecated.
- `SQLParserDialect` (`@memberjunction/sql-dialect`) → `ParserDialect` or a `QueryDialect`.
- `RunQuerySQLFilterManager.SetPlatform` (`@memberjunction/core`): a render for a known provider passes its dialect instead.
- `RunExtractionPipeline` (`@memberjunction/core-entities-server`): saves now extract with `ComputeQueryExtraction` and `WriteExtractedChildRows`.
- `ClientClauseScreen.AstContainsWriteNode` → `StrictFragmentValidator.ValidateReadOnlyStatement`; `QueryPagingEngine.StripTopClause` → `SqlDocument.RowCaps()` and an `EditSet`; the `isPostgres` option of `buildMaterializedReadQuery` → pass the dialect (`@memberjunction/generic-database-provider`).

**Security.** This release closes several ways a saved query, a query specification or caller-supplied SQL could get past the read-only check, and makes it fail closed: every query path now runs the same lexer-based check on the rendered statement, and writes and forbidden function calls are refused when a query is saved. Template values that were written into shipped queries without escaping are now filtered or server-set. Field-level security is enforced on query results, and the refresh service and the Explorer query views show nothing about fields or entities a user may not read. Deployments should upgrade; no configuration is needed beyond the refresh above.
