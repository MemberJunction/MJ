Phase 6 (Track E) — **`WorkflowSpec`: one object binding WHAT runs to WHEN it runs.**

`TaskGraphSpec` answered *what* a workflow does; the scheduling and entity-action substrates answered *when* something fires. Nothing expressed both at once, so "a workflow" was not a thing anyone could hand over — it was a graph plus a separately-configured trigger that only a human knew were related.

**`graph` is `TaskGraphSpec` verbatim, not a copy.** That is why this composes rather than translates: a graph authored on the canvas, emitted by an agent, or promoted from a past run is *already* this shape. A parallel graph type would have re-created the drift Phase 4 spent itself removing.

**No new storage, and that is the design.** There is no `Workflow` table. A workflow's WHAT is a Flow agent; its WHEN is a Scheduled Job. `WorkflowSpecSync` **reconciles** those, following the pattern `MJRecordProcessEntityServer.Save()` already proved — resolve the type, find the rows this definition owns, upsert or disable. Inventing a `Workflow` row would create a second definition of "a scheduled thing" and give the scheduler two masters that can disagree.

Rows are owned by a marker inside their own `Configuration`, not by name, so **renaming a workflow cannot orphan its schedule** and leave a second one firing beside the new row. A trigger the spec no longer names is **disabled, not deleted** — the row carries run counts, last-run and next-run, which are the only record it ever fired.

**Order is load-bearing.** The agent persists *before* triggers reconcile, because a Scheduled Job needs its ID to point at. Reversed, you get a job referencing an agent that does not exist — a schedule that fires forever and does nothing, with no error anyone sees. Validation runs before either, so a rejected save leaves no orphan agent behind.

**Two operations, because drafting and committing are different acts.** `Workflow.Validate` writes nothing, so an agent can iterate a draft before anything reaches the scheduler — the draft-then-confirm shape dry-run and Plan Mode established. `Workflow.Save` commits. Both run the identical validator, so a workflow that validates cannot be rejected on save for a different reason. Together they close the "agents cannot schedule anything" hole: today `Create Scheduled Job` cannot even set `Configuration`.

**Agent persistence crosses a seam.** `AgentSpecSync` is the one place that writes an agent; importing it into the execution substrate would invert the dependency, so the host registers a writer instead. A host without one gets an honest failure rather than a half-saved workflow. The writer reuses Phase 4's `ConvertTaskGraphToAgentSpec` unchanged — "save a runtime graph as a workflow" and "persist a workflow's graph" turn out to be the same operation, which is the practical payoff of the convergence.

**A discovery worth recording:** `AgentScheduledJobDriver` has existed since the scheduling engine shipped, and `ScheduledJobType.DriverClass` is UNIQUE — so the `Agent` job type was already seeded. The substrate for scheduling an agent was there all along; only the authoring surface was missing. TG12 now pins that seed, because without it a scheduled workflow throws at the moment a user is least able to interpret it.

**Draft is the default status**, not Active. Every authoring surface — the canvas, a chat card, an agent's MCP call — produces something the author has not yet watched run against real data.

**Entity-change triggers reconcile too.** My first pass deferred these to Track D on the belief that entity-action invocation was not wired. AN-BC challenged that and was right: `HandleEntityActions` has fired entity actions from the save pipeline all along — validate, before/after save, before/after delete — and `Execute Agent` exists as the dispatch target, written for exactly this. Nothing was missing but the **binding row**. `WorkflowSpecSync` now creates the three rows that express "when an Invoice is updated, run Execute Agent with this agent": the `EntityAction`, the `EntityActionInvocation`, and an `EntityActionParam` carrying the agent. Idempotent by lookup rather than delete-and-recreate, because re-saving a workflow must not detach and re-attach a live trigger — a change landing in that window would be missed.

40 new unit tests (29 validator, 11 sync) plus integration checks TG11 and TG12. IT71 runs 12/12.
