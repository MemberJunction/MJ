Mobile app v6: make realtime voice actually resolve on a device, route hosted applications' generic nav items, and scope the new agent-session grants with row-level security.

**Why `minor`.** The branch adds metadata — two `MJ: Row Level Security Filters` rows and the `UI` role's `MJ: AI Agent Sessions` / `MJ: AI Agent Session Channels` permissions — which becomes a consolidated metadata-sync migration at release.

**Realtime voice could not have worked on a device.** The React Native WebRTC drivers registered against `OpenAILiveClient` / `OpenAIRealtimeClient`, but `ClassFactory` matches on the registered base class's *name* and the session runtime resolves against `BaseRealtimeClient` — so the RN drivers were filed in a bucket lookup never reads, the browser driver won, and `new RTCPeerConnection()` threw under Hermes. They now register against `BaseRealtimeClient` under the same provider keys the browser drivers use, `registerGlobals()` from `react-native-webrtc` runs at module load, and a unit test asserts on the resolved *class* rather than merely that something resolves.

Two related corrections: the RN drivers now override `createAudioSink()` rather than `attachRemoteAudio()` — the latter is where the base driver installs `pc.ontrack`, so overriding it silently removed the remote stream, its subscribers and the output audio meter — and `'xai'` is no longer advertised as supported. Grok Voice speaks the OpenAI protocol but over a websocket with a client-owned PCM plane, so it would have hit the `AudioContext` crash the provider filter exists to prevent.

**Session lifecycle.** `RealtimeSessionRuntime` gains three fixes that apply to every host, Explorer included: a start abandoned mid-flight (the user leaves while the mint is in progress) now releases the microphone, the provider connection and the server-side session instead of leaking all three; concurrent teardowns coalesce onto one run instead of racing into two `Disconnect()` calls and two `CloseAgentSession` mutations; and a host that declines the resolved provider now unwinds through the shared teardown, so channel plugins are disposed rather than left published with live tool handlers. `IRealtimeMediaHost` gains an optional `ReleaseMicrophone()` — iOS is put into a record-and-play audio category for a call, and nothing was putting it back. `LastStartError` lets a host tell a denied microphone apart from a provider failure.

**Agent runs reported failure as success.** `ConversationAgentRunner.processMessage` returns `null` only when no agent resolves; every other failure — a quota rejection, an agent that threw, a transport error — comes back as a well-formed result carrying `success: false`. The mobile send path tested only for `null`, so those turns reported success and left a permanently spinning bubble with no error anywhere in the UI.

**Attachments were uploaded after the agent had already answered.** Photograph an invoice, ask for the totals, and the agent replied "I don't see an attachment" while the file appeared a second later. `SendMessage` now takes an `onUserMessageSaved` hook that runs in the window between the user's row existing and the run starting.

**Hosted applications.** Nav items are parsed into a shape derived from the generated `MJApplicationEntity_IDefaultNavItem` rather than a hand-copy, which restores `RecordID` — the field identifying which record a non-`Custom` item opens. Generic resource types now resolve through the same registry as `Custom` ones, keyed by the type name, and this build ships a `Dashboards` surface backed by the same `DashboardView` the Explorer route mounts. Retired applications and deactivated nav items are filtered the way MJ Explorer filters them, and the launcher's ordering now matches `compareUserApplications`.

**Storage seam corrections.** `MJStorageBlobStore` restores the compensating `DeleteObject` when the `MJ: Files` row fails to save (otherwise a successful upload with a failed row leaves permanently orphaned bytes) and configures `FileStorageEngine` before reading its accounts, so a cold process does not silently fall back to environment-only credentials. `ConversationAttachmentService.DeleteAttachment` now honours the store's return value instead of deleting the row regardless — the anti-orphan guarantee three doc comments promised. The browser store implements `GetDownloadUrl` through `CreateMediaAccessToken`, which is what makes Explorer's new storage-backed attachments readable rather than write-only, and `saveAttachments` accepts the agent whose `InlineStorageThresholdBytes` the decision should honour.

**Security.** The `UI` role's new read/update permissions on agent sessions and session channels are scoped by two new RLS filters (`UI: Own Agent Sessions`, `UI: Own Agent Session Channels`), matching the pattern the Widget Guest rows already use. Unscoped, any signed-in user could read and modify another user's sessions.

The sample application no longer sets `DefaultForNewUser` — a worked example should not install itself into every deployment's new users — and its screen now handles transport failures rather than showing "Loading…" forever on a dead network.
