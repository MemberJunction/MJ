Lift Flyway placeholder escaping from `SqlLogger` into the `SQLDialect` abstraction. Each dialect now declares its own `EscapeFlywayStringInterpolation` form (SQL Server interleaves a `CAST(N'' AS NVARCHAR(MAX))` to defeat the NVARCHAR(4000) concat cap; PostgreSQL uses a plain `||` split since TEXT has no length cap), so the shared `SqlLoggingSessionImpl` can be used safely across providers without hard-coding T-SQL syntax.
