Fix four silent-failure bugs found while triaging the open issue backlog. Each one looked correct from the outside while doing nothing, or doing the wrong thing, at runtime. No schema changes.

**`BaseLLM` silently truncated streamed responses (`@memberjunction/ai`).** The streaming chunk loop caught any mid-stream error, logged it, and then finalized the response as a **success**. A dropped connection, a provider fault, or an abort part-way through a stream produced truncated content that the caller was told was complete — under every provider, for every streaming consumer. Genuine failures now surface as failures; cancellation is still routed to the driver's `finalizeStreamingResponse`, since providers differ on whether an abort throws there or simply ends iteration.

**No LLM driver honored `ChatParams.cancellationToken`** (13 provider packages). The field existed on `ChatParams` and zero drivers read it, so an aborted or timed-out request abandoned the promise while the socket kept streaming and pinning buffers. Now forwarded to the SDK across all 19 drivers — 13 fixed directly, the remaining 6 inheriting from `OpenAILLM` / `GeminiLLM` — on both the streaming and non-streaming paths. The mechanism differs per provider and was verified rather than assumed — Bedrock takes `abortSignal` (not `signal`); Ollama has no per-request hook at all, so the signal is threaded through a custom `fetch`; and `Inception` overrides both chat paths without calling `super`, so it does not inherit the fix from `OpenAILLM` despite appearing to. An abort is reported `Fatal` / `canFailover: false`, because `ErrorAnalyzer` otherwise classifies it as retriable — meaning a request the user just cancelled would have been retried.

**Prompt execution could not be bounded (`@memberjunction/ai-prompts`, `@memberjunction/ai-core-plus`).** On the single-model path the model call was awaited with no bound unless the caller hand-supplied an `AbortSignal`, so a hung provider connection never resolved. Adds a per-request `AIPromptParams.timeoutMS` and a typed `AIPromptTimeoutError` that `ErrorAnalyzer` classifies as retriable, so a timeout now flows into the existing retry/failover machinery instead of hanging. The timeout and any caller-supplied token compose — neither is discarded. Enforcement lives in `executeModel`, the one method the parallel coordinator also inherits, so the single-model and parallel paths cannot diverge. (Issue #3064 was filed as "`AIPromptRunner` does not enforce `AIPrompt.TimeoutMS`", but that column does not exist — the bound could not be expressed at all. A prompt-level column is tracked separately in #3133.)

**A malformed deny-list silently disarmed the Predictive Studio leakage guard** (`@memberjunction/predictive-studio*`, `@memberjunction/core-entities-server`, `@memberjunction/ng-dashboards`). Pasting a bracketed list into the pipeline editor produced `DenyFields: ["[CheckInTime", …, "Status]"]`; the deny-set then matched nothing, so the most dangerous leak columns trained completely unguarded and the save was accepted. The editor no longer manufactures the bad input, a new `MJMLTrainingPipelineEntityServer.ValidateAsync` rejects it at save, and the dominance threshold is clamped at enforcement time so rows written before this validation existed cannot disable the guard. Also unifies `DEFAULT_DOMINANCE_THRESHOLD`, which was defined twice with different values (`0.85` vs `0.6`) — agent-authored pipelines had been held to a materially laxer guard than hand-authored ones.

**Dead CSS shipped to production (`@memberjunction/ng-dashboards`, `@memberjunction/ng-conversations`).** These packages build with bare `ngc` — no Sass step — so `styleUrls` content is embedded verbatim. Native CSS nesting makes `&:hover` accidentally work, but it cannot do string concatenation, so every `&__elem` / `&--modifier` rule was silently dropped. Three components were affected. **This resurrects styling that has never rendered**: the realtime media-surface tab bar had no active-tab indicator, and evidence playback had no active-turn highlight and no played-progress color on its waveform. A new `check:ui-ngc-scss` CI gate prevents the trap re-arming.

Also fixes `@memberjunction/ai-azure`, whose unit tests had never actually run — the package had test files and a vitest config but no `test` script.
