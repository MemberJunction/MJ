Phase 3 of the unified workflow DAG engine program (plan: PR #3456) — durable task graphs become a first-class agent primitive.

**`'Tasks'` joins the Loop response union.** An opted-in agent emits `nextStep.type = 'Tasks'` with a `TaskGraphSpec` and the framework does the rest. The distinction from `subAgents[]` is durability, not parallelism: `subAgents[]` is ephemeral fan-out that blocks the run and dies with it, while a task graph becomes real Task rows a server-side dispatcher owns — visible in the Tasks UI, resumable after a restart, able to wait on a human.

**The capability is gated, and the gate is enforced rather than advisory.** `enableTaskGraphs` defaults to **false**, unlike every other Loop prompt parameter. The others only shape the prompt — turning one off saves tokens and an agent that emits the feature anyway still works. This one governs whether an agent may create durable rows that outlive its run, execute on a dispatcher under the submitting user, and spawn further agent runs. So beyond omitting the type from the prompt, `LoopAgentType` *rejects* a `'Tasks'` step from a disabled agent with a corrective that steers it back to Sub-Agent/Actions. The gate fails closed: an absent flag, an absent params bag, and the string `"true"` are all refusals.

This matters more than it looks, because `HarnessAgentType extends LoopAgentType` and intentionally inherits `DetermineNextStep` — so the primitive reaches external agent harnesses (Claude Code / Codex / Pi running inside MJ) the moment it reaches Loop agents. That inheritance is the design working, but it moves the gate from a nice property of one class to the thing standing between a sandboxed external CLI and durable server-side work. It is therefore tested through the harness path, with the inheritance itself pinned so a later override cannot silently move those assertions onto a different code path.

**`TaskGraphSpec` and its validator move to `@memberjunction/ai-core-plus`,** next to the pure graph algorithms they belong with. That is what lets the agent framework validate a graph without depending on the durable-execution package — which would otherwise drag the entity layer and the dispatcher into every context that merely runs an agent, including unit tests with no database. The Loop type validates against the identical contract the server re-validates at submission (D16), so a graph cannot pass one check and fail a different one later.

**Single-node constant folding (D9), recorded rather than silent.** A one-node graph with no edges, an agent assignee and default continuation is rewritten into an ordinary in-run sub-agent call — don't spin up loop machinery for a loop of one. The `TaskGraph` run step is written either way, carrying the spec, a `folded` flag and the reason. Three consequences: run forensics show why a graph did or didn't reach the dispatcher; a user who edits a two-node graph down to one can read the durability change off the run record instead of inferring it; and Save as Workflow (D17) attaches to the recorded spec, so the single-node case — the shape most likely worth promoting — stays promotable. `durable: true` opts back into a Task row.

**Submission crosses a registered seam.** `TaskGraphSubmitter` is declared in `ai-core-plus` and implemented in `@memberjunction/task-graph`, resolved through the ClassFactory. A host with no durable-execution package gets `null` and the agent reports an honest failure — what must never happen is a graph vanishing quietly while the model believes it scheduled work.

**Continuation contract.** The parent Task row durably carries `continuation`, `reinvokeDepth` and the delivery marker, because the dispatcher instance that finishes a graph is routinely not the one that accepted it. Delivery marks *before* it acts: the worst case becomes a missed notification visible in the task record rather than a notification repeated on every reconciliation sweep forever — which, for `reinvoke`, would be an unbounded agent-run loop. Chains are capped at 5 hops, bounded separately from task-nesting depth because they are different loops; at the cap the mode degrades to `message` so results still reach the user. `'reinvoke'` itself is not wired here — it would invert the dependency to task-graph → ai-agents — and lands in Phase 4 where the dispatcher already holds an execution engine.

**Sage and the Workflow Planner stop payload-smuggling.** Both prompts move from `payloadChangeRequest.newElements.taskGraph` to the real `nextStep`, and the temporary server-side payload sniff introduced in Phase 2 is deleted along with its messaging and scheduling call sites — the primitive submits inside the run, so channel seams no longer need to look.

**Launch opt-ins (D3):** Sage, Workflow Planner, Query Builder, and the Research Agent with its four sub-agents. Workflow Planner is not on the plan's opt-in list, but emitting task graphs is that agent's entire job, so leaving it gated would have broken it outright.

**Coverage:** 43 new unit tests (18 Loop, 5 harness, 20 continuation-metadata) and a new integration check, TG8, asserting both directions the metadata gate can be wrong — an opt-in that was never pushed leaves an agent unable to delegate at all, and a Loop *type* default left on would hand durable reach to every Loop agent in the install at once. IT71 runs 8/8.
