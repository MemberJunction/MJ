Realtime UX wave 2 — the progressive-disclosure console (pure-audio-first overlay with the breathing hero orb, disclosure levels 0–4 ratcheted per-user via UserInfoEngine, gear density escape hatch, unified app-bar, fused composer dock; content never flips the console open — the one auto-reveal is a channel's first agent activity, finished artifacts arrive as glowing unfocused tabs, Activity tab pinned last); audio-reactive call visuals (BaseRealtimeClient GetAudioActivity capability — per-direction RMS + 9-bin spectrum metered on all four drivers via a shared RealtimePcmPlayback master-gain tap / WebRTC stream analysers — driving the hero + app-bar orbs and a true-spectrum EQ through a zero-CD rAF loop, with turn-state fallback). Whiteboard: OneNote-style PAGES (v2 JSON with tolerant v1 migration, AddPage/SwitchPage/RenamePage agent tools, page strip with inline rename + right-click Rename/Delete/New-page context menus, agent-authored page garnish), multi-select (marquee, shift-click, single-undo group drag/delete), hold-to-zoom, multi-page HTML/SVG export, shared active-page note on all item tools, UUIDsEqual compliance. ElevenLabs: tool-schema sanitizer (non-string enums + leaf descriptions, fingerprint-stable) and the absorbed-tool-result voice nudge. Conversations: shared auto-naming helper + race-free realtime naming lifecycle on SessionStarted$, slide-panel splitter rework, angular-split dependency removed. Plus integration-test script groundwork (server/client/runquery cache suites) and cache-layer fixes carried on this branch.
