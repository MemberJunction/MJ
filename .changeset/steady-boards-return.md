Realtime ledger completion + two field bugs. SERVER CHANNEL PLUGIN HALF: `ServerPluginClass` is now consumed — `BaseRealtimeChannelServer` lifecycle contract in @memberjunction/ai, `RealtimeChannelServerHost` (ClassFactory resolution mirroring the client half, per-session instances, failure-isolated hooks, post-close dispose linger) in ai-agents with a `WhiteboardChannelServer` reference impl that validates/canonicalizes landed board saves, wired through SessionManager create/close and the channel-state save path. TRANSCRIPT CORRECTIONS END-TO-END: `RealtimeClientTranscript.ReplacesPrevious` (stamped by the ElevenLabs driver on `agent_response_correction`) replaces the caption in place and `RelayRealtimeTranscript(replacesPrevious)` updates the persisted turn instead of appending. ASSEMBLYAI RESUME WINDOW: one-shot `session.resume` reattach on unexpected socket drop (mic/playout survive; failed/second drop falls through to the old fatal path). WHITEBOARD: widget srcdoc rebuilt per mount via a view-scoped pure pipe — SVG charts survive page switches/lazy remounts, and mounted widgets no longer reload on unrelated journal ops (the old journal-invalidated identity cache was both stale on remount and over-eager on 'replace'). CONVERSATIONS: surface-panel (re)creation lands on the marquee channel tab (the whiteboard) instead of the Activity rail, the agent's first stroke reveals synchronously, and session review now merges channel states across ALL chain legs (newest leg with a saved board wins) so resumed sessions never hide an earlier leg's drawing. Plus Per-Minute/Per-Hour AI model price unit types seeded via metadata.
