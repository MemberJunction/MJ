Realtime co-agent pairing & type configuration. New `MJ: AI Agent Paired Agents` junction (opt-in: a co-agent with zero rows stays universal — today's zero-config default unchanged; rows restrict + prebuild its target list with an IsDefault preselection), `AIAgent.TypeConfiguration` (agent-type-specific JSON: realtime model preference, per-provider voice, tone/speaking style, override policy, narration pacing), and `AIAgentType.ConfigSchema`/`DefaultConfiguration` (the type publishes a JSON Schema + type-level defaults; effective config = type defaults <- agent config <- runtime overrides, deep-merged per key, server-authoritative). Runtime overrides ride a new `configOverridesJson` session-start argument gated by the seeded `Realtime: Advanced Session Controls` authorization (Developer-mapped) — enforced server-side, disclosed client-side (unauthorized users silently get defaults). ValidateAsync server subclasses enforce ConfigSchema conformance, Realtime-type co-agents, and at-most-one-default-per-co-agent. Conversations UX: co-agent picker for everyone with more than one permitted co-agent (persisted via UserInfoEngine), pairing-constrained target selection, authorization-gated model/config override pickers.
