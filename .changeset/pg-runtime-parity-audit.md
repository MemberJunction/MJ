Make the deterministic integration tier runnable against PostgreSQL, and fix the runtime and conversion defects that running it exposed.

**Why.** MJ #3257 records that the integration suite is meant to run twice per build — once per backend — and that this was never implemented. PostgreSQL therefore shipped with migration parity verified and *runtime* parity unverified. This change makes the tier run on PostgreSQL for the first time and fixes what that surfaced: **49 of 61 deterministic bundles now pass on PostgreSQL** (measured, MJAPI live; 61/61 executed, none skipped).

**Harness (closes the #3257 blocker list).** `testing-cli` now branches on platform instead of unconditionally building an `mssql` pool: `mj-provider.ts` gains a PostgreSQL path (dynamic import, declared as an optionalDependency so SQL-Server-only consumers never resolve `pg`) with a PG-native user-cache load, `MJConfig` gains `dbPlatform`, and `getContextUser()` resolves the same user on both backends — System by name, then the well-known System ID, then the first active Owner, with `.trim()` because `Type` is space-padded in both ledgers. `mj.config.cjs` gains `dbPlatform` and a platform-aware `dbPort` default; with `DB_PLATFORM` unset both are exactly the previous SQL Server behaviour.

**Runtime dialect leaks.**
- `SQLDialect` gains `AffectedRowCountSQL()`. `TaskClaimStore` was emitting `SELECT @@ROWCOUNT`, which is T-SQL only — on PostgreSQL the `@@` is consumed as a parameter marker and the bare `ROWCOUNT` folds to lowercase, so *every* guarded write failed with `column "rowcount" does not exist` (7,168 occurrences in one tier run, now zero). SQL Server keeps `@@ROWCOUNT`; PostgreSQL uses a data-modifying CTE.
- `MJDashboardEntityExtended` no longer denies the owner. `Validate()` is synchronous and reads `DashboardEngine`'s cache directly, so in any process using the default `task` startup mode — where engine pre-warm is deferred — an unloaded cache was indistinguishable from "you have no permission", and `mj sync push` failed on a dashboard whose `UserID` *was* the pushing user. `Validate()` now enforces only when the engine is loaded; `Delete()`, being async, loads it first.

**Conversion (T-SQL → PostgreSQL).** Five defects, each caught only by applying the output to a fresh database — the converter reported `0 errors` every time:
- CASE-expression keywords were quoted as identifiers inside `CHECK` bodies (`"CASE" "WHEN" …`), so the migration would not parse. The missing keyword set was derived by intersecting 2,084 `CHECK` bodies across 67 shipped migrations against the dialect keyword list: exactly `CASE`, `WHEN`, `THEN`, `ELSE`, `END`.
- Every `IF EXISTS (…)` batch was classified `SKIP_SQLSERVER` and silently discarded. A guarded `DROP CONSTRAINT` therefore vanished — with exit code 0 — and the paired `ADD CONSTRAINT` later in the same migration failed with "already exists".
- T-SQL table variables became the invalid declaration `v_X TABLE;`; they now become `CREATE TEMP TABLE … ON COMMIT DROP`.
- `DELETE alias FROM … JOIN …` passed through as T-SQL; it now becomes PostgreSQL's `DELETE … USING` (the UPDATE analogue already existed).
- `WITH CHECK ADD CONSTRAINT` survived on non-FK constraints, and `END ELSE BEGIN` left stray tokens. A subtler one: the `DECLARE` indent capture also matched a preceding blank line, which pushed the declaration out of the `DECLARE` section and into the block body.

**Also fixed.** `spDeleteEntityWithCoreDependencies` could not be invoked on PostgreSQL — `callRoutineSQL` always emitted `SELECT * FROM fn(...)`, which PostgreSQL rejects for a `RETURNS SETOF record` routine with no OUT parameters, so entity pruning silently died and cascaded into 22 missing CRUD routines. `callRoutineSQL` gains an optional `expectsResultSet`; SQL Server ignores it. CodeGen's PostgreSQL audit-SQL folder swap was pinned to `v5` by exact match, so on v6 it wrote into the SQL Server tree. `applyLLMPrimaryKeys` validated primary-key names case-insensitively but then used the model's spelling in the `UPDATE`, matching zero rows on PostgreSQL while reporting success — it now uses the matched column's actual name.

**Repeatable metadata refresh.** `R__RefreshMetadata` on PostgreSQL now also clears orphaned `EntityField` rows, as the SQL Server file has always done. Without it a from-scratch PostgreSQL database ends up with metadata describing columns its own base views do not have, and every read of those views fails.

**Two test-authoring fixes, not product changes.** The aggregates bundle passed `MAX(__mj_UpdatedAt)` unquoted and the open-app-teardown fixture called `SYSDATETIMEOFFSET()`; both are SQL-Server-only spellings and are now dialect-quoted.

SQL Server is unaffected: every changed path is either PostgreSQL-only or a same-output refactor. Unit tests across the touched packages pass — SQLDialect 335, SQLConverter 1134, MJCoreEntities 588, TaskGraph 60, testing-cli 23. (CodeGenLib has 10 pre-existing failures in `pg-connection.test.ts`, verified identical with these changes stashed.)
