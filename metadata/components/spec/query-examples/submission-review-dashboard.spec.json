  "userExplanation": "Comprehensive submission review dashboard showing status distribution charts, review timeline, and top reviewers list. Demonstrates complex hybrid pattern: uses multiple queries for charts, direct RunView for reviewer stats, and EntityDataGrid for drilling into submissions by status.",
  "functionalRequirements": "## Business Objectives\n- Monitor event submission review process across all statuses\n- Track review activity and timeline trends\n- Identify top-performing reviewers by volume and quality\n- Enable drill-down into submissions by status for detailed review\n- Demonstrate mixing multiple data loading patterns in one component\n\n## Functional Requirements\n- **Status Summary Chart**: Stacked bar or pie chart showing submission counts by status (Pending, Under Review, Accepted, Rejected, etc.)\n- **Review Timeline Chart**: Line chart showing review activity over time (daily or weekly counts)\n- **Top Reviewers Panel**: Display top 10 reviewers with submission count, average score, and review count\n- **KPI Cards**: Show total submissions, average score, unique speakers, and pending count\n- **Click-to-Drill-Down**: When user clicks status segment, show EntityDataGrid with submissions in that status\n- **Multi-Query Coordination**: Load status summary and timeline queries in parallel\n- **RunView for Reference Data**: Load reviewer records via RunView, aggregate client-side for top reviewers list\n- **Mixed Data Sources**: Demonstrate using RunQuery for charts, RunView for aggregation, EntityDataGrid for drill-down\n- **State Management**: Track selected status and coordinate updates across all panels\n- **Conditional Loading**: Only load drill-down grid when status is selected\n- **Clear Selection**: Return to overview when clearing status filter\n- **Loading States**: Show loading indicators for each panel independently\n- **Empty States**: Handle cases with no submissions or no reviews",
