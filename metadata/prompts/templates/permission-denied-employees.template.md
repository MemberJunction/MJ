# Permission Denied - Employees

I'm sorry, but you don't have the necessary permissions to create employee records.

**Required Permission:**
- Create permission on the Employees entity

This permission is required when onboarding users who will be linked to employee records in the system.

**Next Steps:**
Please contact your system administrator to request the "Create" permission for the Employees entity. Alternatively, you may be able to create users without linking them to employee records.

**Error Details:**
- Missing permission type: Entity Permission
- Entity: Employees
- Required operation: Create
