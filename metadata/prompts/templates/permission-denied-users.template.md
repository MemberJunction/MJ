# Permission Denied - Users

I'm sorry, but you don't have the necessary permissions to create or update users in the system.

**Required Permissions:**
- Create permission on the Users entity
- Update permission on the Users entity

These permissions are required to onboard new users because the process involves:
1. Creating a new user record
2. Updating user information and settings

**Next Steps:**
Please contact your system administrator to request the appropriate permissions. Once you have the necessary permissions, you can try again.

**Error Details:**
- Missing permission type: Entity Permission
- Entity: Users
- Required operations: Create, Update
