## General Specifications

### Analysis Guidelines

1. **Understand Context**: Read and comprehend the full content before summarizing
2. **Identify Key Points**: Extract the most important information, themes, and insights
3. **Maintain Accuracy**: Never introduce information not present in the source
4. **Follow Instructions**: Pay special attention to the `instructions` field for domain-specific focus
5. **Respect Format**: Structure output according to the requested format

### Format Options

- **paragraph**: Single cohesive paragraph with flowing prose
- **bullets**: Bulleted list of key points
- **hybrid**: Brief paragraph followed by bulleted key points

### Length Guidelines

- Target the specified `summaryWords` count (Â±10%)
- Prioritize clarity and completeness over exact word count
- For very short content (< 100 words), focus on extracting essence rather than hitting target length

## Citation Requirements (if `includeCitations` is true)

1. **Select Relevant Quotes**: Choose quotes that:
   - Support key points in the summary
   - Provide specific evidence or examples
   - Represent important claims or findings
   - Add credibility to the summary

2. **Format Citations**:
   - **text**: Extract the exact quote from the content (verbatim)
   - **url**: Construct the source URL (use `sourceUrl` as base)
   - **anchorId**: If the content contains HTML IDs (like `<h2 id="section-name">`), include the anchor ID
   - **context**: Provide 1-2 sentences of surrounding context
   - **relevance**: Explain why this quote is important (1 sentence)

3. **Citation Guidelines**:
   - Limit to `maxCitations` total citations
   - Prioritize quality over quantity
   - Ensure citations are evenly distributed across main themes
   - If HTML anchors are available, use them for precise linking

## Metadata Extraction

Extract the following metadata from the content:

- **pageTitle**: Main title or heading (from `<title>`, `<h1>`, or prominent heading)
- **sourceUrl**: The provided source URL

## Output Format

Return a JSON object with this structure:

```json
{
  "summary": "The main summary text in the requested format",
  "wordCount": 195,
  "citations": [
    {
      "text": "Exact quote from content",
      "url": "https://example.com/page#anchor-id",
      "anchorId": "anchor-id",
      "context": "Brief context around the quote",
      "relevance": "Why this quote matters"
    }
  ],
  "keyPoints": [
    "Key point 1",
    "Key point 2"
  ],
  "metadata": {
    "pageTitle": "Document Title",
    "sourceUrl": "https://example.com/page"
  }
}
```

### Field Requirements

- `summary`: **Required** - The main summary text
- `wordCount`: **Required** - Actual word count of the summary
- `citations`: **Optional** - Only include if `includeCitations` is true
- `keyPoints`: **Optional** - Only include if format is `bullets` or `hybrid`
- `metadata`: **Required** - Document metadata

## Quality Guidelines

1. **Objectivity**: Maintain a neutral, informative tone
2. **Clarity**: Use clear, accessible language
3. **Coherence**: Ensure logical flow and structure
4. **Completeness**: Cover all major themes and topics
5. **Precision**: Be specific rather than vague
6. **Attribution**: All citations must be accurate and verifiable

## Example Output

### Paragraph Format (with citations)

```json
{
  "summary": "The document outlines a comprehensive framework for building enterprise applications using a metadata-driven architecture. It emphasizes the importance of separating business logic from presentation layers through entity abstraction and code generation. The framework supports multiple database backends and provides automatic CRUD operations, validation, and relationship management. Key benefits include reduced development time, improved maintainability, and consistent data access patterns across the application stack.",
  "wordCount": 62,
  "citations": [
    {
      "text": "Metadata-driven development reduces boilerplate code by up to 80% while maintaining type safety and developer productivity",
      "url": "https://docs.example.com/architecture#benefits",
      "anchorId": "benefits",
      "context": "The section discusses quantifiable advantages of the framework compared to traditional development approaches.",
      "relevance": "This quote provides concrete evidence of the framework's efficiency gains."
    }
  ],
  "metadata": {
    "pageTitle": "Architecture Overview - Enterprise Framework Documentation",
    "sourceUrl": "https://docs.example.com/architecture"
  }
}
```

### Hybrid Format (with key points)

```json
{
  "summary": "The document presents a modern approach to enterprise application development through metadata-driven architecture and code generation.",
  "wordCount": 18,
  "keyPoints": [
    "Metadata layer separates business logic from implementation details",
    "Automatic code generation for entities, APIs, and UI components",
    "Support for multiple databases with unified access patterns",
    "Built-in validation, relationships, and CRUD operations",
    "Significant reduction in development time and maintenance costs"
  ],
  "metadata": {
    "pageTitle": "Architecture Overview",
    "sourceUrl": "https://docs.example.com/architecture"
  }
}
```

## Error Handling
