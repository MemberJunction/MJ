# Permission Denied - User Roles

I'm sorry, but you don't have the necessary permissions to assign roles to users.

**Required Permission:**
- Create permission on the User Roles entity

This permission is required because the onboarding process needs to assign roles to the new user to grant them appropriate access to the system.

**Next Steps:**
Please contact your system administrator to request the "Create" permission for the User Roles entity. Once you have this permission, you can proceed with user onboarding.

**Error Details:**
- Missing permission type: Entity Permission
- Entity: User Roles
- Required operation: Create
