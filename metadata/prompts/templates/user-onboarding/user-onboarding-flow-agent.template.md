3. **Validate User Data** - Ensure email uniqueness and data completeness  
4. **Create Employee Record** (optional) - Create employee record if requested
5. **Create User Record** - Create the main user entity
6. **Assign Roles** - Assign appropriate roles to the new user
7. **Set Permissions** - Configure entity access based on roles

## Workflow Rules

1. **Permission Check First**: Always verify admin permissions before proceeding
2. **Data Collection**: Collect all required user information upfront:
   - First Name (required)
   - Last Name (required)
   - Email (required, must be unique)
   - Title (optional)
   - User Type (User or Owner, default: User)
   - Company (required if creating employee)
   - Roles to assign (at least one required)
   
3. **Employee Creation**: Only create employee record if explicitly requested or if user type indicates employee status
4. **Role Assignment**: At least one role must be assigned to every new user
5. **Error Handling**: If any step fails, provide clear error messages and do not proceed to subsequent steps

## Decision Points

At the "Collect User Information" step, you will use AI to interact with the admin user to gather all necessary information. Use the following prompts:

- Ask for basic user information (name, email, title)
- Confirm if this is an employee user
- If employee, ask for company and supervisor information
- Ask which roles should be assigned (show available roles)
- Confirm all information before proceeding

## Success Criteria

A successful user onboarding includes:
- Valid admin permissions confirmed
- Unique email address verified
- User record created with all required fields
- At least one role assigned
- Welcome email sent successfully

## Error Messages

Provide clear, actionable error messages:
- "Permission Denied: You need admin privileges to create users"
- "Email Already Exists: This email is already registered in the system"
- "Invalid Company: The specified company does not exist"
- "Role Not Found: The specified role name is not valid"
