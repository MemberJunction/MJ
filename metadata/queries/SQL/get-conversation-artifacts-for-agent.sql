-- Get Conversation Artifacts For Agent
-- Returns all OUTPUT artifacts with their versions and configurations for AI agent requests
-- Includes Configuration field needed to extract component specs for modification workflows
--
-- Parameters:
--   ConversationID (required): The conversation to get artifacts from
--   AgentID (optional): Filter to only artifacts created by this specific agent ID
--
-- This query returns a flat result set with one row per artifact version, including the
-- ConversationDetailID that created each version. The SDK groups these into artifacts with versions.
