      "userMessage": "Create an interactive network graph showing connections between members based on shared activities. Each member should be a node, and draw edges between members who have participated in the same events or taken the same courses. The strength of the connection (edge thickness) should be based on the number of shared activities. Use a force-directed layout so nodes naturally cluster together based on their connections. Color-code the nodes by their primary chapter membership, and size them by their total engagement level. Make the graph interactive with zoom and pan capabilities. When I click on any member node, show me a detail card or panel displaying their profile information (name, membership type, engagement score) along with a list of their connections - show the connected members and what activities they share. Then, when I click on any connection in that list, show me a detailed table of the actual shared activities between those two members (events, courses) with dates and details. Finally, make sure I can click on any activity in that table to open the event or course record. Include tooltips when hovering over nodes to show basic member info."
