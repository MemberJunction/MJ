      "UserQuestion": "Which products are our top performers? Show me best-selling products by revenue, optionally filtered by category.",
      "Description": "Unified product ranking query that ranks products by revenue with optional category filtering. Replaces both top-products-ranking.sql and category-top-products.sql. When Category parameter omitted, ranks across all categories. When Category provided, ranks within that category. Returns TOP N products (default 10) with revenue, quantity, invoice count, and average price metrics. General-purpose query for product performance analysis. **Result Order: TotalRevenue DESC** - Highest revenue products first for performance ranking.",
      "SQL": "@file:SQL/product-ranking.sql",
      "TechnicalDescription": "Groups paid invoice line items by ProductName and Category. TOP N configurable (default 10). Returns: ProductName, Category, TotalRevenue (SUM), TotalQuantity (SUM), InvoiceCount (COUNT DISTINCT), AvgPrice (AVG). Joins vwProducts → vwInvoiceLineItems → vwInvoices with filters: Status='Paid', IsActive=1. Supports optional Category filter (when provided, acts like category-top-products; when omitted, acts like top-products-ranking). Also supports StartDate, EndDate filters. This consolidation eliminates query duplication while maintaining backward compatibility.",
