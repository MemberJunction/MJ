# Task Orchestration Implementation Status

## ✅ Completed Features

### 1. Core Task Orchestration
- [x] TaskOrchestrator service with parent/child task hierarchy
- [x] Parent task links to ConversationDetailID
- [x] Child tasks link via ParentID only
- [x] Dependency management and topological execution
- [x] Payload passing between dependent tasks
- [x] Duplicate tempId detection and filtering

### 2. Conversation Manager Integration
- [x] Unified task graph format in prompt
- [x] Detection of taskGraph in payload
- [x] Separate handling for single vs multi-step workflows
- [x] Proper UX messaging:
  - Single task: "👉 Delegating to **Agent Name**"
  - Multi-step: Shows workflow name and task list

### 3. UI Flow
- [x] Conversation Manager message completes immediately with delegation info
- [x] Separate task execution message created (Role=AI, no AgentID)
- [x] Task execution message threaded under CM message
- [x] Final success/error status updates

### 4. Artifact Handling (Server-Side)
- [x] Automatic artifact creation from agent payloads
- [x] Uses agent's `DefaultArtifactTypeID` when available
- [x] Falls back to JSON artifact type
- [x] Artifacts linked to conversation via ConversationDetailArtifactEntity
- [x] All task outputs preserved as artifacts

### 5. Error Handling
- [x] Task failures handled gracefully
- [x] Parent task progress tracking
- [x] GraphQL error propagation
- [x] Enhanced error logging in Angular

## 🚧 Known Issues

### 1. "Unknown error" in UI (IN PROGRESS)
**Symptom**: Task execution completes successfully on server, but UI shows "Unknown error"

**Debug Added**:
- Added detailed logging of GraphQL response
- Added check for `result.errors` array
- Will show actual error message when you test next

**Next Steps**: Test again and check console for the actual error details

### 2. No Real-Time Progress Updates
**Symptom**: PubSub progress messages published on server but not displayed in UI

**Root Cause**: Angular conversation component doesn't subscribe to PubSub

**What Works**:
- Server publishes task progress via PubSub ✅
- Server publishes agent progress via PubSub ✅
- Final success/error message updates ✅

**What Doesn't Work**:
- Real-time progress display in task execution message ❌
- Live updates as tasks progress ❌

**To Fix** (Future Enhancement):
1. Subscribe to PubSub in conversation component
2. Parse TaskOrchestrator progress messages
3. Update task execution message.Message in real-time
4. Show progress like: "⏳ Running task 1 of 3: Research Companies (45%)"

## 📊 Data Flow

```
User: "Write me a blog..."
  ↓
Conversation Manager → taskGraph payload
  ↓
handleTaskGraphExecution():
  1. Update CM message: "👉 Delegating to Marketing Agent" ✅
  2. Create task execution message: "⏳ Starting workflow..." ✅
  3. Call ExecuteTaskGraph mutation
     ↓
TaskOrchestrationResolver:
  1. Create parent + child tasks ✅
  2. Execute tasks with dependencies ✅
  3. Publish PubSub progress (not shown in UI yet) ⚠️
  4. Create artifacts from payloads ✅
  5. Return success result ✅
     ↓
  4. Update task execution message: "✅ Workflow completed" ✅ (if no error)
```

## 🔍 Testing Checklist

- [ ] Test single-task workflow (should say "Delegating to X")
- [ ] Test multi-task workflow (should show task list)
- [ ] Verify artifacts are created and linked
- [ ] Verify artifacts use correct type (check DefaultArtifactTypeID)
- [ ] Check console for GraphQL errors
- [ ] Verify final success/error message
- [ ] Check that CM message completes immediately
- [ ] Verify task execution message is threaded properly

## 🎯 Next Steps

### Immediate
1. **Fix "Unknown error"** - Check console logs to see actual GraphQL error
2. **Verify artifact type** - Ensure DefaultArtifactTypeID is being used

### Future Enhancements
1. **Real-time progress streaming** - Subscribe to PubSub and update UI
2. **Task timeline component** - Show Gantt chart of tasks
3. **Artifact preview** - Show artifacts inline in conversation
4. **Retry failed tasks** - Allow manual retry of failed tasks
5. **Task cancellation** - Add ability to cancel running workflows

## 📁 Files Modified

### Backend
- `/packages/MJServer/src/services/TaskOrchestrator.ts` - Artifact creation, deduplication
- `/packages/MJServer/src/resolvers/TaskResolver.ts` - GraphQL resolver

### Frontend
- `/packages/Angular/Generic/conversations/src/lib/components/message/message-input.component.ts`
  - handleTaskGraphExecution() method
  - taskGraph detection in Stage 2 and Stage 4
  - Enhanced error logging
  - DefaultArtifactTypeID usage

### Metadata
- `/metadata/prompts/templates/conversations/conversation-manager-agent.template.md`
  - Always return task graph format
  - Added workflowName field

## 🐛 Debug Commands

```bash
# Check server logs for task execution
tail -f server.log | grep "TASK GRAPH"

# Check for GraphQL errors in browser console
# Look for: "📊 ExecuteTaskGraph result:"

# Query tasks in database
SELECT * FROM [MJ: Tasks] WHERE ParentID IS NOT NULL ORDER BY __mj_CreatedAt DESC

# Query artifacts
SELECT a.*, av.* FROM [MJ: Artifacts] a
JOIN [MJ: Artifact Versions] av ON a.ID = av.ArtifactID
ORDER BY a.__mj_CreatedAt DESC
```
