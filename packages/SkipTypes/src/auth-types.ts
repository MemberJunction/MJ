/**
 * @fileoverview Authentication and API key types for Skip API
 * 
 * This file contains types related to authentication and API key management
 * within the Skip API system. These types define the structure for:
 * 
 * - API key specifications for different AI vendors (SkipAPIRequestAPIKey)
 * 
 * The authentication system allows clients to provide API keys for various
 * AI service providers that Skip will use on behalf of the client. This enables
 * Skip to access different AI models and services while maintaining security
 * by not storing these credentials permanently.
 * 
 * The vendor driver names correspond to registered classes in the MemberJunction
 * AI namespace that provide standardized interfaces to different AI providers
 * such as OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and others.
