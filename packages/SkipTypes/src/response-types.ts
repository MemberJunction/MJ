/**
 * @fileoverview Specific API response types for Skip API
 * 
 * This file contains specialized response types that extend the base SkipAPIResponse for different
 * response phases and scenarios. These types define the structure for:
 * 
 * - Analysis completion responses (SkipAPIAnalysisCompleteResponse)
 * - Clarifying question responses (SkipAPIClarifyingQuestionResponse)  
 * - Data request responses (SkipAPIDataRequestResponse)
 * - Chat with record responses (SkipAPIChatWithRecordResponse)
 * - Drill-down functionality for components (SkipAPIAnalysisDrillDown, SkipAPIAnalysisDrillDownFilter)
 * 
 * Each response type corresponds to a specific responsePhase value and contains additional
 * properties relevant to that particular type of response. These specialized response types
 * allow clients to access type-safe, context-specific data based on the response phase.
 * 
 * The analysis complete response is particularly comprehensive, containing component data,
 * explanations, column metadata, drill-down information, and component options.
