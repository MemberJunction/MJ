/**
 * @fileoverview AI Agent and learning cycle types for Skip API
 * 
 * This file contains types related to AI agent functionality, learning cycles, and
 * human-in-the-loop interactions within the Skip API system. These types define the structure for:
 * 
 * - Agent notes and note types (SkipAPIAgentNote, SkipAPIAgentNoteType)
 * - Agent requests for human approval/feedback (SkipAPIAgentRequest)
 * - Learning cycle processes (SkipAPILearningCycleRequest, SkipAPILearningCycleResponse)
 * - Change tracking for learning cycles (various SkipLearningCycle*Change types)
 * 
 * The learning cycle functionality allows Skip to analyze conversation history and improve
 * its performance over time by generating notes, updating queries, and creating agent
 * requests based on patterns it discovers in user interactions.
 * 
 * Agent requests enable human-in-the-loop workflows where Skip can ask for approval or
 * guidance on specific actions, ensuring that AI decisions align with organizational
 * policies and user preferences.
 * 
 * Notes provide a way for Skip to store and retrieve organizational knowledge, user
 * preferences, and contextual information that improves future interactions.
