/**
 * This file contains the fundamental API request and response types used for communication
 * between client applications and the Skip API server. These types define the core data
 * structures for:
 * 
 * - Main API requests and responses (SkipAPIRequest, SkipAPIResponse)
 * - API result wrapper for MJ API server responses (MJAPISkipResult)
 * - Request and response phase enumerations
 * - Special API request types (SkipAPIRunScriptRequest)
 * 
 * These types form the foundation of the Skip API communication protocol and are used
 * across all Skip API interactions regardless of the specific functionality being invoked.

/**
 * Describes the different request phases that are used to communicate with the Skip API Server
 * The phase of the conversation, defined as follows:
 * * initial_request: The initial request from the user - when a new conversation gets started or after a report is created, pass in this value
 * * clarify_question_response: Sometimes the Skip API server responds back to your request with a responsePhase of 'clarifying_question' - in this situation, the MJAPI server needs to communicate with the UI to ask the follow up question to the user. When you have that feedback from the user gathered and are providing the response to the clarifying question back to Skip API, use this requestPhase
 * * data_gathering_response: Sometimes the Skip API server responds back to your request with a responsePhase of 'data_request' - in this situation, the MJAPI server needs to process the data request, gather whatever additional data the Skip API has asked for, and then return it in the dataContext property of the SkipAPIRequest object. When you are finished gathering data and returning it to the Skip API server, use this requestPhase
 * * data_gathering_failure: When you send an API request to the Skip API server saying there was a data_gathering_failure that means that you attempted to retrieve data Skip requested but there was (typically) an error in the SQL statement that Skip generated and it needs to be regenerated. The MJAPI server code handles this scenario automatically.
 * * run_existing_script: Use this to run an existing script that was already processed. When this option is used, the script provided is run and the results are provided in the response.
 * * chat_with_a_record: This is used for the simple record chatting feature that is separate from other Skip API features. This is used for having a chat conversation with Skip about a specific record in the database that the user is typically looking at in a UI.
