# Change Log - @memberjunction/global

## 5.38.0

### Minor Changes

- 30f598d: Two intertwined deliverables in one PR: the autotag-website overhaul, plus a new dynamic forms-extension architecture (`BaseFormPanel` slot system) that lets consumers extend generated entity forms without the heavyweight custom-form override pattern.

  ## Autotag website crawler overhaul

  Fixes the long-standing "only crawls the seed page" symptom and adds first-class run budgets, a streaming pipeline, and per-source UI knobs.

  **Fixes**
  - `AutotagWebsite` now respects `MaxDepth` out of the box — the recursive crawler was previously gated on a flag that defaulted to falsy, so most sources only ever scraped the start URL. Class-level defaults are now `MaxDepth=2`, `CrawlSitesInLowerLevelDomain=true`, `CrawlOtherSitesInTopLevelDomain=false`.
  - Change-detection (the "is this page changed?" short-circuit) was rewritten to fetch each URL once instead of two or three times, hash the **extracted body text** (not raw HTML — eliminates spurious "changed" verdicts from CSRF tokens / build hashes / server timestamps), and scope the dedup query to the current `ContentSourceID` (a 404 boilerplate from one site no longer masks real pages on another).
  - `visitedURLs` state is now reset per content source — was leaking across sources and silently deduping legitimate URLs.
  - Conservative URL normalization (strip fragment, collapse trailing slash, sort query params; path case preserved per RFC 3986) so common variants dedupe correctly.
  - Several smaller bugs: `URLPattern` regex now applied in the shallow path too, `Number.isFinite` guard prevents NaN-cascade in the depth check.

  **Features**
  - **Streaming pipeline.** `ExtractTextAndProcessWithLLM` now accepts `AsyncIterable<MJContentItemEntity>` in addition to arrays. The website crawler streams items into the LLM batcher as they pass change-detection — total wall-clock is `~max(crawl, classify)` instead of `crawl + classify`. Backwards-compatible: existing array callers (AutotagEntity, tests) are unchanged.
  - **`MaxItemsPerRun` run budget.** Most intuitive "do at most N this run, do the rest next time" cap. Wired into `AutotagWebsite` (which had no budget integration before) and `AutotagEntity` (which already had the other RunBudget knobs). Pause is graceful via the existing CancellationRequested machinery; next run picks up where it left off (change-detection skips already-tagged items).
  - **Per-source Website crawler UI.** New "Website Crawler Settings" section on the Content Source form (conditional on Website source type) with structured inputs for MaxDepth, RootURL, URLPattern (live regex validation), and toggles for the recursion + sibling-fan-out flags. The Tag Pipeline section gets a promoted "Max items / run" primary row.

  **Storage**
  - `IContentSourceConfiguration` extended with a typed `MaxItemsPerRun?: number` and `Website?: IContentSourceWebsiteConfiguration` sub-object. The new `MJContentSourceEntity_IContentSourceWebsiteConfiguration` interface is now exported from `@memberjunction/core-entities`.
  - `AutotagWebsite` reads website knobs from the typed `Configuration.Website` first, then overlays `ContentSourceParam` rows as a sharper-per-instance override (legacy sources configured the old way keep working).
  - Per-key coercion at the param-overlay boundary fixes a latent bug where DB-stored strings were silently stuffed into number/boolean-typed instance fields.

  **Tests**

  162 tests pass (up from 119). New coverage spans URL normalization, fetch-once / extracted-text hashing, the streaming engine path (AsyncIterable batching, partial-batch flush, resume), `MaxItemsPerRun` budget enforcement, and the `Configuration.Website` overlay.

  **Docs**

  `packages/ContentAutotagging/README.md` documents the new streaming diagram, the Website Crawl Settings table, the Run Budgets table with priority order, and the resume semantics.

  **Known follow-ups** (not in this PR)
  - True crawl-side resume that persists discovered URLs so re-runs skip the HTTP re-discovery — today's resume is "functional via change-detection dedup."
  - `ETag` / `If-Modified-Since` conditional GETs on re-crawls (needs new columns on `MJContentItem`).

  ## `BaseFormPanel` slot system (`@memberjunction/ng-base-forms`)

  Generated entity forms can now be extended **without** replacing them via a `*Extended` custom-form override. Author a standalone Angular component extending `BaseFormPanel`, decorate with `@RegisterClassEx(BaseFormPanel, { metadata: { entity, slot, sortKey } })`, declare in any module. `<mj-form-panel-slot>` hosts in the generated form discover matching panels at runtime and dynamically mount them.

  **Slot positions** (top → bottom): `top-area`, `before-fields`, `after-fields`, `after-related`, `after-everything`.

  **Fallback chain** via `FormSlotCoordinator`: if the registered slot is missing because CodeGen hasn't been rerun against the new template emitter, the panel walks forward in the chain until it finds an existing slot. `MjRecordFormContainer` ALWAYS emits `after-everything` in its template, so panels never dead-end — pre-CodeGen-regen forms display every panel (at the bottom); post-regen forms display them in the preferred position.

  New public exports from `@memberjunction/ng-base-forms`:
  - `BaseFormPanel<TRecord>` abstract directive
  - `FormPanelSlot` type union
  - `FormPanelRegistrationMetadata` interface
  - `<mj-form-panel-slot>` component
  - `FormSlotCoordinator` service
  - `FORM_SLOT_CHAIN` constant

  Custom `*Extended` forms (e.g. `AIAgentFormComponentExtended`) remain a first-class pattern for truly bespoke layouts where the generated form is the wrong starting point entirely.

  Full authoring guide in `packages/Angular/Generic/base-forms/PANELS.md`.

  ## `@RegisterClassEx` + ClassFactory metadata (`@memberjunction/global`)

  Existing `@RegisterClass` keeps its exact positional signature (zero breaking changes) but also accepts an optional 6th `metadata` arg for parity. New `@RegisterClassEx(baseClass, options)` is the modern form when you have anything beyond `(baseClass, key, priority)` to specify — options-bag avoids positional-boolean noise and is the right place to attach `metadata`.

  New public exports from `@memberjunction/global`:
  - `RegisterClassEx` decorator
  - `RegisterClassOptions` interface
  - `ClassRegistration.Metadata` field (optional, additive)
  - `ClassFactory.GetAllRegistrationsByKeyPrefix(base, prefix)` — common structured-key case (case-insensitive, trimmed)
  - `ClassFactory.GetAllRegistrationsByKeyPattern(base, regex)` — nuanced key matching
  - `ClassFactory.GetAllRegistrationsByMetadata(base, predicate)` — recommended for structured discriminators

  The `Ex` suffix follows MJ's existing `Foo`/`FooAsync`/`FooEx` convention. Not a true TS overload — JS overloads are hacky compared to true OOP, and sibling decorators give cleaner IntelliSense + a clean deprecation path if we ever consolidate.

  MJGlobal README adds a "Structured registration" section documenting both decorators + all three lookup helpers.

  ## Knowledge Hub dashboard quick-edit (`@memberjunction/ng-dashboards`)

  The AI > Autotagging Pipeline dashboard's "Edit Content Source" slide-in is intentionally a **quick-edit surface**, not a full form. Added the most-useful subset of the new knobs:
  - `MaxItemsPerRun` (always shown — most-asked-for budget cap)
  - `MaxDepth` + 2 crawl toggles (Website-source-conditional)
  - **"Open advanced settings →"** link that calls `NavigationService.OpenEntityRecord('MJ: Content Sources', id)` to land in the full entity form, where every panel is available via the slot system.

  ## Documentation
  - `packages/Angular/Generic/base-forms/PANELS.md` (NEW) — comprehensive BaseFormPanel authoring guide.
  - `packages/Angular/CLAUDE.md` — restructured "Extending Entity Forms" section. Both patterns first-class.
  - `packages/Angular/Explorer/core-entity-forms/README.md` — new "Two Patterns" section above the existing custom-form guide.
  - `guides/CONTENT_AUTOTAGGING_GUIDE.md` — extended config table (all budget caps + `Website` sub-object) + UI section pointing at PANELS.md.
  - `packages/MJGlobal/README.md` — new "Structured registration: `@RegisterClassEx` + metadata" section.
  - Root `CLAUDE.md` — new "Nested CLAUDE.md Index" pointing at every sub-directory CLAUDE.md.

  ## Follow-ups (not in this PR)
  - Promote source-type-specific form sections to a registered class extension point when the count grows past 2-3 (e.g., RSS, Cloud Storage). Today's `IsWebsiteSourceType` template gate works fine for 1-2 source types.

### Patch Changes

- 3d739a3: refactor(sql-parser): instance-based parser with dialect adapters, parse-preprocessing, instance-based count SQL, and a render-pipeline write-statement guard
  - **`SQLParser` is now instance-based** (`new SQLParser(sql, dialect)`). AST inspection/mutation (`IsValid`, `StatementKind`, `HasWriteStatement`, `OuterCap`, `SetOuterCap`, `ClearOuterCap`, `ClearOrderBy`, `ToSQL`) and extraction (`ExtractCTEs`, `ExtractTableRefs`, `ExtractColumnRefs`, `ExtractSelectColumns`) are instance members; pure string/token utilities (`ParseSQL`, `SqlifyAST`, `StripComments`, `Tokenize`, `Analyze`, `HasUnwrappableTrailingClause`, `HasStackedStatements`, the MJ-template helpers, …) remain static.
  - **Dialect-neutral row caps via an internal `ASTDialectAdapter`** (keyed by `ParserDialect`). The exported `SQLOuterCap` (with its `kind: 'top' | 'limit'`) is replaced by `RowCapInfo` with an explicit `form: 'numeric' | 'percent' | 'opaque'` discriminant. The `isSQLServerDialect()` quote-probe and the `dialect.PlatformKey === 'sqlserver'` branch in the row-cap path are gone (`outerWrap` now uses `dialect.LimitClause()`).
  - **Parse-preprocessing fallback** in the constructor: on a direct-parse failure it aliases bracket-quoted identifiers with parser-defeating characters (`[Active People]`, `[my-cte]`) and splits a trailing `OPTION (...)` clause, then restores both on `ToSQL`. This lets Skip-style CTE queries and `OPTION` queries reach the precise AST row-cap path (`TOP N` / `LIMIT N`) instead of the OFFSET/FETCH or outer-wrap fallback.
  - **Instance-based count SQL**: `QueryPagingEngine`'s count builder is unified onto the instance API (`ExtractCTEs` + `ClearOuterCap` + `ClearOrderBy` + `ToSQL`), removing the last `as unknown as Record<string, unknown>` cast and raw AST field pokes from the engine. The count now strips the outer cap on **both** dialects, so a paged query's `COUNT(*)` reflects the full set — fixing a PostgreSQL inconsistency where an explicit `LIMIT` previously yielded a capped count (SQL Server already stripped `TOP`).
  - **Render-pipeline safety guard** (`RenderPipeline.Run`): a rendered query must be a single read statement, enforced by two complementary checks. (1) `SQLParser.HasWriteStatement` (AST) rejects a write _type_ anywhere — DML (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE/MERGE/REPLACE), DDL (DROP/CREATE/ALTER/TRUNCATE/RENAME), or EXEC/CALL/GRANT/REVOKE/USE — catching single writes and parseable stacked writes (`SELECT 1; DROP TABLE x`). (2) `SQLParser.HasStackedStatements` (token scan) rejects any internal statement-separating `;`, catching stacked payloads that don't parse (`SELECT 1; EXEC xp_cmdshell '…'`, `SELECT 1; WAITFOR DELAY '…'`) — the class an AST scan misses because the whole string fails to parse. Both are precise: the `REPLACE()` string function and parenthesized SELECTs pass, and a single trailing `;` is fine; only genuine multi-statement inputs (including `SET` / `DECLARE` prefixes) are rejected. (The broad dangerous-keyword scan stays on the ad-hoc execution path, where input is untrusted free text.)
  - **`SQLExpressionValidator`**: `FOR` is now allowed in `full_query` context so `FOR JSON` / `FOR XML` queries aren't wrongly rejected (`FOR UPDATE` remains blocked via the independent `UPDATE` keyword).

  No behavior change for already-valid read queries; preprocessing only widens AST coverage, the count fix only affects paged queries that carried an explicit cap, and the guard only rejects writes/stacked statements. All consumers (`queryPagingEngine`, `queryCompositionEngine`, `query-extraction`, `manage-metadata`, `structuralParser`) migrated to the instance API.

## 5.37.0

## 5.36.0

## 5.35.0

### Minor Changes

- ac4b9a5: **Multi-tenant switching** (`@memberjunction/global`, `@memberjunction/ng-explorer-core`): Add `TenantChanged` event type to `MJEventType`. Add `clearCacheByPredicate()` on `ComponentCacheManager` for selective tenant-scoped cache clearing. Add `ClearComponentCache()` and `ReloadAllTabs()` on `TabContainerComponent` — destroys cached components and reloads the active tab immediately (inactive tabs reload lazily). Shell subscribes to `TenantChanged` with two-phase protocol: `TenantChanging` shows the loading screen, `TenantChanged` reloads tabs and hides it. Loading screen CSS made `position: fixed` with `z-index: 99999` to fully cover viewport during switches.

  **Open App fixes** (`@memberjunction/open-app-engine`): Make `mj app upgrade` idempotent when already at target version. Allow mixed-case schema names in Open App manifest validation.

  **CodeGen fix** (`@memberjunction/codegen-lib`): Emit `override` modifier on generated `Save()` method to satisfy strict TypeScript when entity subclasses override the base `Save()`.

  **AI Agents dashboard** (`@memberjunction/ng-dashboards`): Fix category filter not filtering results, make category filter extraction defensive, fix Reset Filters button. Rename Actions `ExecutionMonitoringComponent` to avoid name collision with dashboards package.

  **Scheduling** (`@memberjunction/server`): Warn loudly when a scheduled job is configured to run more often than every 5 minutes.

  **Palette** (`@memberjunction/ng-ui-components`): Add ARIA labels to icon-only buttons in dialogs and slides for accessibility compliance.

## 5.34.1

## 5.34.0

### Patch Changes

- 389d356: Fix XSS vulnerability in search-result highlighters across form-field labels, collapsible-panel section names, and conversation search snippets. Extracted shared `HighlightSearchMatches` helper in `@memberjunction/global` that escapes each text segment individually after a literal-string match, so HTML in the source can never leak into `[innerHTML]` as live markup. Also restored multi-match highlighting that had regressed to single-match.

## 5.33.0

### Patch Changes

- 5cc5326: PostgreSQL end-to-end support — first MJ release where a fresh PG database can be migrated, codegen'd against, signed into, and synced from `mj sync push` without manual intervention. Plus a structural cleanup pass over how the stack handles the database-platform vocabulary and dialect-aware SQL.

  ### PG fresh-install path
  - **`@memberjunction/postgresql-dataprovider`** — replaces the `Nested transactions are not yet supported` throw with full SAVEPOINT-based nesting (mirrors SQL Server's depth/savepoint model). Adds the missing `ValidateDeleteResult` override that the Phase-2 Save/Delete refactor introduced for SS but skipped for PG, so `BaseEntity.Delete()` correctly recognizes successful deletes on PG. RDS-compatible startup wrapper (no `pg_catalog` writes, rejected by managed PG). Per-connection transaction mutex prevents interleaved BEGIN on shared connections during `mj sync` fan-out.
  - **`@memberjunction/sql-converter`** — new `ConditionalDDLRule` handlers for SS-only patterns that previously survived into PG output untranslated: `IF NOT EXISTS (sys.schemas …) EXEC('CREATE SCHEMA [X]')` → `CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS "X"`, and `sp_addextendedproperty` schema descriptions → `COMMENT ON SCHEMA "X" IS '...'`. Function-output now emits a `DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS` guard before recreate so re-runs don't trip "function … is not unique." `ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS` for idempotent column-add migrations. `bit`-parameter body coercion + tagged dollar-quoting on `DO` blocks containing nested `$$`.
  - **`@memberjunction/codegen-lib`** — PG `CodeGenProvider` emits `spCreate*` / `spUpdate*` / `spDelete*` matching the SS-ported baseline (was `fn_create_<snake>`). `pgDialect.ParameterRef` produces `p_<flat lowercase>` matching baseline + runtime `buildCRUDParams`. Without these, every `Save()` against PG failed with `function does not exist`. Pre-pass in `spUpdateExistingEntityFieldsFromSchema` reseats stale negative `Sequence` values from prior interrupted runs at the tail of each entity's positive range, eliminating `UQ_EntityField_EntityID_Sequence` collisions on re-runs. PG-output statement termination — `;` after `INSERT`, `ALTER`, etc. so generated `CodeGen_Run_*.pg.sql` replays cleanly.
  - **`@memberjunction/cli`** (`mj migrate`) — fresh-PG-install blockers: now reads `DB_PLATFORM` from env to select dialect (was config-only); auto-defaults `dbPort` to 5432/1433 based on inferred platform; defaults `BaselineVersion` to `'1'` (Skyway sentinel meaning "auto-select highest-versioned `B__` baseline file"). Without these, `mj migrate` against a PG `.env` silently constructed a `SqlServerProvider`.

  ### Single source of truth for database-platform vocabulary

  Addresses code-review feedback that the stack had three parallel definitions of the same concept and a normalizer in the middle "translating" between them.
  - **`@memberjunction/global`** — new canonical `DatabasePlatform` type (`'sqlserver' | 'postgresql'`) and `resolveDbPlatformFromEnv()` helper that reads from `DB_PLATFORM`. STRICT — only the canonical pair is recognized; legacy aliases (`mssql`, `postgres`, `pg`) are no longer honored, and unrecognized non-empty values **throw** rather than silently falling back to `'sqlserver'`. The earlier dev-only `DB_TYPE` env var is no longer consulted.
  - **`@memberjunction/core`** and **`@memberjunction/sql-dialect`** — both packages re-export `DatabasePlatform` from global instead of defining their own copies.
  - **`@memberjunction/codegen-lib`** — config schema drops `dbType` entirely. `dbPlatform` is the only field. The `dbType()` exported helper is renamed to `dbPlatform()`. `normalizeDbPlatformAndType()` and its tests are deleted.
  - **`@memberjunction/cli`** and **`@memberjunction/server`** — drop their local `resolveDbPlatformFromEnv` copies in favor of the global helper. MJServer's `getDbType()` is now a 1-line wrapper.

  ### SQLDialect as the single source of truth for SQL type ↔ category mapping

  Replaces 5+ hand-coded SQL type-name lists scattered across the codebase ("when you see this pattern repeat, alarm bells").
  - **`@memberjunction/sql-dialect`** — each dialect now exposes 11 typed getters listing the SQL type names IT uses for each conceptual category: `BooleanTypeNames`, `StringTypeNames`, `DateTypeNames`, `IntegerTypeNames`, `FloatTypeNames`, `UuidTypeNames`, `BinaryTypeNames`, `JsonTypeNames`, `CurrencyTypeNames`, `IntervalTypeNames`, `NetworkTypeNames`. New `typeClassification.ts` module unions both dialects into cross-platform predicates (`IsBooleanSQLType`, `IsStringSQLType`, …, plus `IsNumericSQLType` aggregate). New `LowerCase(expr)` method on the base dialect (default `LOWER(${expr})`, ANSI-portable) replaces hardcoded `LOWER(...)` strings in callers. New `BooleanParameterType()` returns `'bit'` on SS, `'boolean'` on PG — used by codegen to emit dialect-correct tolerant-SP `_Clear` parameter declarations. Adding a future dialect = implementing the getters; no other site changes.
  - **`@memberjunction/core`** — `DatabaseProviderBase` gains a `Dialect: SQLDialect` getter, lazily resolved from `PlatformKey`. Server-side code can now write `provider.Dialect.BooleanLiteral(true)` etc. without independently importing `GetDialect`. `util.ts` `TypeScriptTypeFromSQLType` and `FormatValueInternal` rewritten over the predicates — ~70 lines of hardcoded switches collapse to ~25 lines of dispatches. New dep on `@memberjunction/sql-dialect`.
  - **`@memberjunction/codegen-lib`** — `getTypeGraphQLFieldString` 50-line switch replaced with predicate dispatch. `createNewUser.ts` boolean filter that previously avoided dialect-specific SQL via client-side `.filter()` post-pass now uses `dialect.BooleanLiteral(true)` and filters server-side.
  - **`@memberjunction/metadata-sync`** — `sync-engine.ts` lookup-filter type detection uses `IsUuidSQLType` / `IsDateSQLType` instead of a hand-maintained `!== 'uuid' && !== 'datetime' && …` chain. `LOWER()` wrapping goes through `dialect.LowerCase()`. `PushService.ts:isTextLikeColumn` is now a one-liner over `IsStringSQLType`. New dep on `@memberjunction/sql-dialect`.
  - **`@memberjunction/server`** — `auth/newUsers.ts` and `resolvers/IntegrationDiscoveryResolver.ts` boolean filters that previously loaded all rows + filtered client-side now run server-side via `provider.Dialect.BooleanLiteral(true)`.
  - **`@memberjunction/core-entities-server`** — `MJApplicationEntityServer.server.ts` IsActive filter on Users moved server-side via `provider.Dialect.BooleanLiteral(true)`. `MJTemplateContentEntityServer.server.ts` AI enrichment now wrapped in a SAVEPOINT so failures don't poison the outer Save tx (PG's whole-tx-aborts-on-stmt-error policy made this fatal where SS treated it as a per-stmt skip).

  ### Cross-dialect runtime fixes
  - **`@memberjunction/sql-dialect`** — `pgDialect.ParameterRef` flat-lowercase contract; PG type → GraphQL `String` mapping for `character`, `varchar`, `citext`. `sqlDialect.ts` runtime SQL emission: `INTEGER`, `DOUBLE`, `PRECISION`, `BYTEA`, `OID`, `REGCLASS`, `REGPROC`, `NAME` added to `autoQuoteIdentifiers` keyword set so casts in hand-written SQL (`CAST(x AS INTEGER)`) stop being quoted as user-defined types. New `coerceBooleanLiteralsInSQL` pass rewrites SS bit literals (`Bool = 1` / `= 0` / `!= 1` / `<> 0`) to `TRUE`/`FALSE` for fields whose `TSType` is Boolean — fixes `operator does not exist: boolean = integer` for `ExtraFilter` clauses across engines, agents, and dashboards.
  - **`@memberjunction/codegen-lib`** — `applyPermissions` inner catch was binding `e` and shadowing the outer `EntityInfo` loop variable, producing `Error executing permissions file ... for entity undefined` log lines. Renamed to `sqlError` with `instanceof Error` typed message extraction.
  - **`@memberjunction/metadata-sync`** — `mj sync push` tolerates UUID case mismatches (PG returns lowercase, SS returns uppercase) on lookup resolution. `@file:` JSON references serialize to `jsonb` correctly on PG (was double-stringifying via the SS path).
  - **`@memberjunction/core`** (`baseEntity.ts`) — string default values now strip PG's typed-literal wrapper (`'Single'::character varying` → `Single`) before assignment so `MaxLength` validation doesn't fail on the wrapper length.
  - **`@memberjunction/core`** (`entityInfo.ts`) — multi-`IsNameField` resolution rule: when more than one field is marked, prefer the one literally named `Name`. Without this rule the pick depended on insertion order (PG returns DisplayName first, SS returns Name first), producing wrong codegen view aliases on PG.

  ### Breaking changes (for direct config consumers)
  - Any user `mj.config.cjs` with `dbType: 'mssql'` or `dbType: 'postgresql'` must rename to `dbPlatform: 'sqlserver'` or `dbPlatform: 'postgresql'`. The `dbType` field is removed.
  - Any user `.env` with `DB_TYPE=...` must rename it to `DB_PLATFORM=...`. The legacy `DB_TYPE` env var is no longer consulted at all (no fallback). `DB_PLATFORM` accepts only `sqlserver` or `postgresql` (case-insensitive); legacy aliases (`mssql`, `postgres`, `pg`) and any other non-empty value throw a clear "Invalid DB_PLATFORM value" error at startup rather than silently routing the wrong provider.
  - Both `dbType`/`DB_TYPE` were dev-only additions during PG support development (Feb 2026, first appeared in v5.30.0). They were never documented as customer-facing and never exposed a stable contract.

  ### Validation
  - 2,536 unit tests passing across the 8 affected packages (`@memberjunction/global` 381, `@memberjunction/core` 1099, `@memberjunction/sql-dialect` 213, `@memberjunction/codegen-lib` 435, `@memberjunction/metadata-sync` 220, `@memberjunction/server` 188), 0 failed.
  - Fresh-DB PostgreSQL replay clean: `DROP SCHEMA __mj CASCADE` → `mj migrate` applies 127/127 migrations, produces 316 `spCreate*` + 319 `spUpdate*` functions, with 0 `EntityField` rows in the staging-band Sequence range.
