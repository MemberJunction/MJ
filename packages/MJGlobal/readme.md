# @memberjunction/global

The `@memberjunction/global` library is designed to coordinate events and components across MemberJunction. This library exports a `MJGlobal` class along with a `RegisterClass` function decorator to manage class registration with the global class factory. It also exports some core elements from the `./ClassFactory` and `./interface` modules for ease of use.

## Installation

```bash
npm install @memberjunction/global
```

## Usage

Below are some usage examples based on the provided code:

### Importing the Library

```javascript
import * as MJ from '@memberjunction/global';
```

### Using the MJGlobal Class

```javascript
// Getting the singleton instance of MJGlobal
const globalInstance = MJ.MJGlobal.Instance;

// Registering a component
globalInstance.RegisterComponent(yourComponent);

// Raising an event
globalInstance.RaiseEvent(yourEvent);

// Listening for events
const listener = globalInstance.GetEventListener();
```

### Using the RegisterClass Decorator

```javascript
@MJ.RegisterClass(yourBaseClass)
class YourClass {
  // ...
}
```
