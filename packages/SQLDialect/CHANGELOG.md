## 5.47.0

### Patch Changes

- 06a1e44: Make the Open-App metadata teardown dialect-driven with full PostgreSQL parity. The FK-graph cascade in `RemoveAppEntityMetadata` (introduced for SQL Server) now runs on **both SQL Server and PostgreSQL**: identifier quoting comes from the provider's `SQLDialect` (`QuoteSchema`/`QuoteIdentifier`) and the FK-graph catalog query comes from a new `SQLDialect.ForeignKeyGraphSQL(schema)` (SQL Server `sys.foreign_keys`; PostgreSQL `pg_catalog.pg_constraint`, with source-column nullability + composite-FK column-count). Previously PostgreSQL fell back to a hardcoded ~6-entity delete list that **under-deleted** (missing e.g. `RecordChange`), so a used PG app could fail remove/reinstall on a foreign-key violation — that path is now the same complete cascade as SQL Server. The provider-selection gate is `has-a-Dialect` (no longer `!== 'postgresql'`), and only a caller that passes no provider uses the legacy entity-layer fallback. Polymorphic tables are covered via their real single-column `EntityID` FK (nullable → `SET NULL`, NOT-NULL → `DELETE`); the FK-less `RecordID` string half is out of scope (a separate single-record-delete concern).
- 31da520: Open-App teardown review follow-ups. Completes the "Dialect owns it" direction and hardens the seam:
  - **`SQLDialect.AtomicBatchScript(statements)`** (new, SS + PG) now owns the all-or-nothing transaction/session wrapper, so `buildTeardownBatchScript` no longer sniffs `PlatformKey` — the last platform branch leaves the OpenApp engine.
  - `RemoveAppEntityMetadata` is now exported from the package index; a deterministic, self-cleaning **integration suite** (`open-app-teardown-tests.ts`, registered in `run-all.ts`) codifies the used-app remove/reinstall scenario (blocking `RecordChange` + link-less fixed-GUID `Application` → clean teardown → re-create without `PK_Application` collision).
  - `RemoveApp` now passes the context's bound provider (not `undefined`) into `RemoveAppEntityMetadata`, so its metadata reads honor the multi-provider rule instead of the process-global `Metadata`.
  - **PostgreSQL schema-name case-sensitivity** (found via a full PG install → remove lifecycle — the true test of PG parity): PostgreSQL folds unquoted identifiers, so an app whose manifest declares schema `__mj_BizAppsTasks` is created + registered on the `Entity` rows as `__mj_bizappstasks`, while the `OpenApp` record keeps the manifest casing. `RemoveAppEntityMetadata`'s case-sensitive `SchemaName = '…'` therefore matched **zero** entities on PG — the teardown silently cleared nothing yet reported success (masked on SQL Server by case-insensitive collation). The entity lookup, the SchemaInfo cleanup, and `buildRootDoomedPredicate` now compare `LOWER(SchemaName) = LOWER(…)`, so the teardown works on PostgreSQL. Without this, the FK-graph PG "parity" was mechanism-correct but never actually deleted anything for a real CLI-installed app.
  - **Reinstall idempotency** (found via a full install → remove → reinstall lifecycle): `mj app remove` soft-removes (keeps the `OpenApp` row + its `OpenAppDependency` rows), so a reinstall reused that record and the blind dependency insert collided on `UQ_OpenAppDep`. `RecordInstallationAtomically` now clears any pre-existing dependency rows for the app in the same transaction group before re-recording (delete-then-insert, atomic — mirrors the upgrade path). Reinstall of a previously-removed app now succeeds.
  - SQL Server `ForeignKeyGraphSQL` gains `ORDER BY fk.name` (deterministic edge/statement order) and a note that disabled FKs are intentionally included (conservative-safe).
  - Docs corrected to match the has-a-Dialect gate (both dialects run the cascade); the migration-declared-`Application` scan is documented as SQL-Server-only (a PostgreSQL follow-up); `RunFkGraphTeardown`/`RemoveAppEntityMetadata` now warn that the raw-SQL teardown bypasses the `BaseEntity` pipeline (no cache invalidation) for in-process callers; the cross-schema-FK limitation and the downloaded-migrations temp-dir cleanup are addressed.

### Patch Changes

- b98366b: Integration framework hardening for wide-catalog and multi-level connectors (extracted from the 20-connector close-out; no connector-specific code).
  - **Wide-table safety (dialect-driven in-row size + column-count limits).** The row-size knowledge now lives in the dialect abstraction, not in platform string-branching: `SQLDialect` gains `MaxInRowSizeBytes` (SQL Server `8060`, PostgreSQL `null`), `MaxColumnCount` (SQL Server `1024`, PostgreSQL `1600`), and `EstimateInRowBytes(rawSqlType)` (SQL Server's per-type in-row footprint; base default a conservative off-row pointer). `SchemaBuilder` consumes these via `GetDialect()` — for a dialect with a hard in-row limit it keeps all primary-key columns + a declared-priority core subset within budget, defers the rest (they still sync and land in `__mj_integration_CustomOverflow`), and emits a structured warning instead of shipping a table that fails every `INSERT` with `Cannot create a row of size … greater than 8060`; a dialect with no in-row limit (PostgreSQL/TOAST) only gets a soft advisory near its column-count cap. `IntegrationEngine` adds an env-clamped per-table column ceiling (`MJ_INTEGRATION_MAX_COLUMNS_PER_TABLE`, max 1000 = SQL Server's 1024 minus framework column headroom) so column-count-driven failures degrade to a reversible auto-disable at apply time. Proven on netFORUM (wide objects 8/17 → 15/17, zero 8060 INSERT failures); 17 row-size unit tests.
  - **Multi-level template-var traversal.** `BaseRESTIntegrationConnector.ResolveParentForVar` adds a per-variable parent map (`Configuration.parentObjectNames` `{ "<var>": "<SiblingObject>" }`, with optional `parentObjectIDFieldNames`), checked before the existing single-valued `parentObjectName`. This lets a path with more than one template variable (e.g. `/events/{eventCode}/sessions/{sessionCode}/…`) resolve each variable to its own parent object instead of collapsing both to one parent and tripping the `PARENT_CYCLE` guard (→ 0 rows). Backward-compatible: connectors that declare no `parentObjectNames` are unaffected.
  - **Large-catalog ApplyAll performance.** `IntegrationDiscoveryResolver.createEntityAndFieldMaps` reuses the already-in-memory persisted field schema (built in Phase 1) instead of issuing a live per-object `DiscoverFields` describe in a sequential loop, and resolves the target entity via an `O(1)` `schema.table → EntityInfo` map instead of an `O(N²)` scan. This removes the per-object round-trips and ~millions of comparisons that pushed very large catalogs (e.g. Salesforce's ~1,695 objects) past the client timeout with zero maps created.

### Patch Changes

- c0b40c0: `mj sync push` performance overhaul and a related `BaseEntity` fix for fixed-width string columns.

  Measured on a representative ~36,500-record `metadata/` tree (mostly idempotent, including a `metadata/integrations/` dir with 23,789 records):
  - Full sync (incl. integrations): ~6m 49s → **~1m 4s** (~6.5×)
  - Partial sync (excluding integrations): ~1m 37s → **~30.5s** (~3.2×)

  ### `@memberjunction/metadata-sync`
  - **`SyncMetadataEngine`** (new, extends `BaseEngine`) preloads every touched entity once via `BaseEngine.Load` and exposes the result through dynamic per-entity property slots that the sync path consults instead of round-tripping the DB per record. Preload is _unfiltered_ — metadata entities are bounded by design and loading all rows is faster than computing a giant `WHERE … IN (…)` clause, plus it lets `@lookup:` resolution hit the cache even for records not in local files. Oversize warning fires above 100,000 rows on any single entity.
  - **O(1) PK index** built after preload completes. Each per-entity slot is mirrored into a `Map<serializedPK, BaseEntity>`; `loadEntity` uses it for hash lookups instead of the previous `Array.find(... serializePrimaryKey(GetAll()))` scan. This was the single biggest fix — on `MJ: Integration Object Fields` the naïve scan was ~1.2B comparisons (~38 min); the Map drops it to seconds. Self-healing array-scan fallback handles drift from `BaseEngine` event-driven slot mutations.
  - **Resolved-lookup + file content caches**. Resolved `@lookup:` keys memoized in a per-entity-scoped `Map<lookupKey, ID>`; parsed `@include`-preprocessed file contents memoized and invalidated at every write site so multi-pass writes always see fresh contents.
  - **Skip preload for unresolved PK refs** (`@lookup:` / `@parent:` / `@root:` / `@file:` / `@env:` / `@template:`) — those values resolve later in the per-record path. Without this guard the preload would inline literal `@lookup:…` strings into a `WHERE ID = '…'` filter and SQL Server would reject the uniqueidentifier cast.
  - `SyncEngine.getProvider()` is now the single entry point for provider plumbing in cache and lookup writes — no more reaching for `Metadata.Provider` directly.

  ### `@memberjunction/core`, `@memberjunction/sql-dialect`

  Fixed-width / space-padded character types (`nchar`/`char` on SQL Server; `char`/`character`/`bpchar` on PostgreSQL) used to surface their storage padding through `BaseEntity.Get`, causing `Dirty` to compare `"Input     "` against `"Input"` and false-positive every record as dirty. Once preload populated the in-memory comparison this manifested as thousands of spurious "updates" per sync (~4,279 on `MJ: Action Params` alone).
  - New `IsFixedWidthStringSQLType` predicate in `@memberjunction/sql-dialect` plus an abstract `FixedWidthStringTypeNames` getter on `SQLDialect` so the list of fixed-width type names stays in one place per dialect.
  - New `EntityFieldInfo.FixedWidthColumn` getter delegating to the predicate.
  - `EntityField.Value` setter and `BaseEntity.Get` raw fast-path now rtrim string values when `FixedWidthColumn` is true, memoizing back into `_raw` so the trim runs at most once per field per record.

  The `BaseEntity` change is independent of MetadataSync but was exposed by the preload work and is required for the "Unchanged" counts in `mj sync` to be accurate.

## 5.33.0

### Minor Changes

- 5cc5326: PostgreSQL end-to-end support — first MJ release where a fresh PG database can be migrated, codegen'd against, signed into, and synced from `mj sync push` without manual intervention. Plus a structural cleanup pass over how the stack handles the database-platform vocabulary and dialect-aware SQL.

  ### PG fresh-install path
  - **`@memberjunction/postgresql-dataprovider`** — replaces the `Nested transactions are not yet supported` throw with full SAVEPOINT-based nesting (mirrors SQL Server's depth/savepoint model). Adds the missing `ValidateDeleteResult` override that the Phase-2 Save/Delete refactor introduced for SS but skipped for PG, so `BaseEntity.Delete()` correctly recognizes successful deletes on PG. RDS-compatible startup wrapper (no `pg_catalog` writes, rejected by managed PG). Per-connection transaction mutex prevents interleaved BEGIN on shared connections during `mj sync` fan-out.
  - **`@memberjunction/sql-converter`** — new `ConditionalDDLRule` handlers for SS-only patterns that previously survived into PG output untranslated: `IF NOT EXISTS (sys.schemas …) EXEC('CREATE SCHEMA [X]')` → `CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS "X"`, and `sp_addextendedproperty` schema descriptions → `COMMENT ON SCHEMA "X" IS '...'`. Function-output now emits a `DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS` guard before recreate so re-runs don't trip "function … is not unique." `ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS` for idempotent column-add migrations. `bit`-parameter body coercion + tagged dollar-quoting on `DO` blocks containing nested `$$`.
  - **`@memberjunction/codegen-lib`** — PG `CodeGenProvider` emits `spCreate*` / `spUpdate*` / `spDelete*` matching the SS-ported baseline (was `fn_create_<snake>`). `pgDialect.ParameterRef` produces `p_<flat lowercase>` matching baseline + runtime `buildCRUDParams`. Without these, every `Save()` against PG failed with `function does not exist`. Pre-pass in `spUpdateExistingEntityFieldsFromSchema` reseats stale negative `Sequence` values from prior interrupted runs at the tail of each entity's positive range, eliminating `UQ_EntityField_EntityID_Sequence` collisions on re-runs. PG-output statement termination — `;` after `INSERT`, `ALTER`, etc. so generated `CodeGen_Run_*.pg.sql` replays cleanly.
  - **`@memberjunction/cli`** (`mj migrate`) — fresh-PG-install blockers: now reads `DB_PLATFORM` from env to select dialect (was config-only); auto-defaults `dbPort` to 5432/1433 based on inferred platform; defaults `BaselineVersion` to `'1'` (Skyway sentinel meaning "auto-select highest-versioned `B__` baseline file"). Without these, `mj migrate` against a PG `.env` silently constructed a `SqlServerProvider`.

  ### Single source of truth for database-platform vocabulary

  Addresses code-review feedback that the stack had three parallel definitions of the same concept and a normalizer in the middle "translating" between them.
  - **`@memberjunction/global`** — new canonical `DatabasePlatform` type (`'sqlserver' | 'postgresql'`) and `resolveDbPlatformFromEnv()` helper that reads from `DB_PLATFORM`. STRICT — only the canonical pair is recognized; legacy aliases (`mssql`, `postgres`, `pg`) are no longer honored, and unrecognized non-empty values **throw** rather than silently falling back to `'sqlserver'`. The earlier dev-only `DB_TYPE` env var is no longer consulted.
  - **`@memberjunction/core`** and **`@memberjunction/sql-dialect`** — both packages re-export `DatabasePlatform` from global instead of defining their own copies.
  - **`@memberjunction/codegen-lib`** — config schema drops `dbType` entirely. `dbPlatform` is the only field. The `dbType()` exported helper is renamed to `dbPlatform()`. `normalizeDbPlatformAndType()` and its tests are deleted.
  - **`@memberjunction/cli`** and **`@memberjunction/server`** — drop their local `resolveDbPlatformFromEnv` copies in favor of the global helper. MJServer's `getDbType()` is now a 1-line wrapper.

  ### SQLDialect as the single source of truth for SQL type ↔ category mapping

  Replaces 5+ hand-coded SQL type-name lists scattered across the codebase ("when you see this pattern repeat, alarm bells").
  - **`@memberjunction/sql-dialect`** — each dialect now exposes 11 typed getters listing the SQL type names IT uses for each conceptual category: `BooleanTypeNames`, `StringTypeNames`, `DateTypeNames`, `IntegerTypeNames`, `FloatTypeNames`, `UuidTypeNames`, `BinaryTypeNames`, `JsonTypeNames`, `CurrencyTypeNames`, `IntervalTypeNames`, `NetworkTypeNames`. New `typeClassification.ts` module unions both dialects into cross-platform predicates (`IsBooleanSQLType`, `IsStringSQLType`, …, plus `IsNumericSQLType` aggregate). New `LowerCase(expr)` method on the base dialect (default `LOWER(${expr})`, ANSI-portable) replaces hardcoded `LOWER(...)` strings in callers. New `BooleanParameterType()` returns `'bit'` on SS, `'boolean'` on PG — used by codegen to emit dialect-correct tolerant-SP `_Clear` parameter declarations. Adding a future dialect = implementing the getters; no other site changes.
  - **`@memberjunction/core`** — `DatabaseProviderBase` gains a `Dialect: SQLDialect` getter, lazily resolved from `PlatformKey`. Server-side code can now write `provider.Dialect.BooleanLiteral(true)` etc. without independently importing `GetDialect`. `util.ts` `TypeScriptTypeFromSQLType` and `FormatValueInternal` rewritten over the predicates — ~70 lines of hardcoded switches collapse to ~25 lines of dispatches. New dep on `@memberjunction/sql-dialect`.
  - **`@memberjunction/codegen-lib`** — `getTypeGraphQLFieldString` 50-line switch replaced with predicate dispatch. `createNewUser.ts` boolean filter that previously avoided dialect-specific SQL via client-side `.filter()` post-pass now uses `dialect.BooleanLiteral(true)` and filters server-side.
  - **`@memberjunction/metadata-sync`** — `sync-engine.ts` lookup-filter type detection uses `IsUuidSQLType` / `IsDateSQLType` instead of a hand-maintained `!== 'uuid' && !== 'datetime' && …` chain. `LOWER()` wrapping goes through `dialect.LowerCase()`. `PushService.ts:isTextLikeColumn` is now a one-liner over `IsStringSQLType`. New dep on `@memberjunction/sql-dialect`.
  - **`@memberjunction/server`** — `auth/newUsers.ts` and `resolvers/IntegrationDiscoveryResolver.ts` boolean filters that previously loaded all rows + filtered client-side now run server-side via `provider.Dialect.BooleanLiteral(true)`.
  - **`@memberjunction/core-entities-server`** — `MJApplicationEntityServer.server.ts` IsActive filter on Users moved server-side via `provider.Dialect.BooleanLiteral(true)`. `MJTemplateContentEntityServer.server.ts` AI enrichment now wrapped in a SAVEPOINT so failures don't poison the outer Save tx (PG's whole-tx-aborts-on-stmt-error policy made this fatal where SS treated it as a per-stmt skip).

  ### Cross-dialect runtime fixes
  - **`@memberjunction/sql-dialect`** — `pgDialect.ParameterRef` flat-lowercase contract; PG type → GraphQL `String` mapping for `character`, `varchar`, `citext`. `sqlDialect.ts` runtime SQL emission: `INTEGER`, `DOUBLE`, `PRECISION`, `BYTEA`, `OID`, `REGCLASS`, `REGPROC`, `NAME` added to `autoQuoteIdentifiers` keyword set so casts in hand-written SQL (`CAST(x AS INTEGER)`) stop being quoted as user-defined types. New `coerceBooleanLiteralsInSQL` pass rewrites SS bit literals (`Bool = 1` / `= 0` / `!= 1` / `<> 0`) to `TRUE`/`FALSE` for fields whose `TSType` is Boolean — fixes `operator does not exist: boolean = integer` for `ExtraFilter` clauses across engines, agents, and dashboards.
  - **`@memberjunction/codegen-lib`** — `applyPermissions` inner catch was binding `e` and shadowing the outer `EntityInfo` loop variable, producing `Error executing permissions file ... for entity undefined` log lines. Renamed to `sqlError` with `instanceof Error` typed message extraction.
  - **`@memberjunction/metadata-sync`** — `mj sync push` tolerates UUID case mismatches (PG returns lowercase, SS returns uppercase) on lookup resolution. `@file:` JSON references serialize to `jsonb` correctly on PG (was double-stringifying via the SS path).
  - **`@memberjunction/core`** (`baseEntity.ts`) — string default values now strip PG's typed-literal wrapper (`'Single'::character varying` → `Single`) before assignment so `MaxLength` validation doesn't fail on the wrapper length.
  - **`@memberjunction/core`** (`entityInfo.ts`) — multi-`IsNameField` resolution rule: when more than one field is marked, prefer the one literally named `Name`. Without this rule the pick depended on insertion order (PG returns DisplayName first, SS returns Name first), producing wrong codegen view aliases on PG.

  ### Breaking changes (for direct config consumers)
  - Any user `mj.config.cjs` with `dbType: 'mssql'` or `dbType: 'postgresql'` must rename to `dbPlatform: 'sqlserver'` or `dbPlatform: 'postgresql'`. The `dbType` field is removed.
  - Any user `.env` with `DB_TYPE=...` must rename it to `DB_PLATFORM=...`. The legacy `DB_TYPE` env var is no longer consulted at all (no fallback). `DB_PLATFORM` accepts only `sqlserver` or `postgresql` (case-insensitive); legacy aliases (`mssql`, `postgres`, `pg`) and any other non-empty value throw a clear "Invalid DB_PLATFORM value" error at startup rather than silently routing the wrong provider.
  - Both `dbType`/`DB_TYPE` were dev-only additions during PG support development (Feb 2026, first appeared in v5.30.0). They were never documented as customer-facing and never exposed a stable contract.

  ### Validation
  - 2,536 unit tests passing across the 8 affected packages (`@memberjunction/global` 381, `@memberjunction/core` 1099, `@memberjunction/sql-dialect` 213, `@memberjunction/codegen-lib` 435, `@memberjunction/metadata-sync` 220, `@memberjunction/server` 188), 0 failed.
  - Fresh-DB PostgreSQL replay clean: `DROP SCHEMA __mj CASCADE` → `mj migrate` applies 127/127 migrations, produces 316 `spCreate*` + 319 `spUpdate*` functions, with 0 `EntityField` rows in the staging-band Sequence range.

### Patch Changes

- 312fcee: Fix two runtime SQL paths that referenced an entity's `BaseTable` directly, which fails under tightened DB grants (the runtime app user has SELECT only on BaseViews and EXECUTE on CRUD sprocs). Both paths now read from `BaseView` and route their identifier, string-literal, and bounded-string-cast generation through `SQLDialect` so the same code produces correct SQL on SQL Server, PostgreSQL, and any future supported platform.

  Adds three new helpers to `SQLDialect`: `QuoteStringLiteral` (concrete, both dialects share `''`-doubling escape), `QuoteColumnAlias` (abstract — bare on SQL Server, double-quoted on PG to preserve case), and `CastToBoundedString` (concrete, composed from existing `ResolveAbstractType` so it emits `NVARCHAR(450)` on SQL Server and `VARCHAR(450)` on PG).

  Refactored sites: `ScheduledGeocodingAction` orphan-cleanup `NOT EXISTS` filter, and `BuildChildDiscoverySQL` (IS-A subtype probe) on both `SQLServerDataProvider` and `PostgreSQLDataProvider` — the latter two also fix the runtime-failing `FROM [schema].[BaseTable]` shape that fired on every IS-A entity load and on the `FindISAChildEntity` GraphQL resolver.

- 7add405: Lift Flyway placeholder escaping from `SqlLogger` into the `SQLDialect` abstraction. Each dialect now declares its own `EscapeFlywayStringInterpolation` form (SQL Server interleaves a `CAST(N'' AS NVARCHAR(MAX))` to defeat the NVARCHAR(4000) concat cap; PostgreSQL uses a plain `||` split since TEXT has no length cap), so the shared `SqlLoggingSessionImpl` can be used safely across providers without hard-coding T-SQL syntax.
