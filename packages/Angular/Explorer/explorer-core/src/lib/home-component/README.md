## Integration Notes

### For Kendo UI Integration
When ready to integrate Kendo UI components, you can:
1. Replace the loading spinner with `<kendo-loader>`
2. Replace cards with `<kendo-card>` components
3. Add `<kendo-badge>` for status indicators
4. Use `<kendo-button>` for actions

Required Kendo modules:
```typescript
import { ButtonsModule } from '@progress/kendo-angular-buttons';
import { CardModule } from '@progress/kendo-angular-layout';
import { IndicatorsModule } from '@progress/kendo-angular-indicators';
```

## Browser Support
- Modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Graceful degradation for older browsers

## Future Enhancements
- Add animation for card entry (stagger effect)
- Implement user preferences for card layout
- Add quick actions on hover
- Support for custom navigation item colors
- Full Kendo UI component integration when ready
