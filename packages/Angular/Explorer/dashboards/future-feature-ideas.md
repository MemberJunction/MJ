# Component Studio - Future Feature Ideas

## 1. Component Library Management

### Favorites/Bookmarks ⭐ (In Progress)
- Star frequently used components for quick access
- Uses MemberJunction's built-in `SetRecordFavoriteStatus` / `GetRecordFavoriteStatus` functionality
- Favorites persist per user across sessions
- Quick filter to show only favorited components

### Recent History
- Show last 5-10 recently viewed/edited components
- Persistent across sessions
- Clear history option

### Component Collections
- Allow users to create custom collections/groups beyond namespaces
- Share collections with team members
- Public/private collection visibility

## 2. Enhanced Search & Discovery

### Advanced Filters
- Filter by component type (Report, Dashboard, Form, Chart, etc.)
- Filter by status (Published, Draft, Archived)
- Filter by date modified (Last 24h, 7 days, 30 days, custom range)
- Filter by author/creator
- Combine multiple filters with AND/OR logic

### Search Suggestions
- Auto-complete with component names as you type
- Show recent searches
- Popular search terms

### Search in Code/Spec
- Option to search within component code, not just metadata
- Regex support for advanced searches
- Highlight matches in code view

## 3. Component Preview & Testing

### Preview Pane
- Small preview/thumbnail when hovering over a component card
- Quick preview mode without fully running component
- Generate static previews for faster loading

### Test Data Sets
- Save and manage test data configurations for components
- Share test data across team
- Quick data generation for common patterns

### Component Playground
- Dedicated mode with mock data generators for testing
- Isolated environment for experimentation
- Save playground sessions for later

## 4. Collaboration Features

### Component Comments
- Add notes/comments to components for team communication
- Thread discussions on specific components
- @mention team members

### Version Comparison
- Visual diff between component versions
- Rollback to previous versions
- Branch/merge component changes

### Share Links
- Generate shareable links to specific components
- Time-limited access tokens
- Read-only vs edit permissions

## 5. Developer Experience

### Keyboard Shortcuts
- `/` or `Cmd+K` for quick search
- `Cmd+Enter` to run selected component
- `Cmd+S` to save changes
- `Cmd+D` to duplicate component
- `?` to show keyboard shortcuts help

### Component Templates
- Start from pre-built templates for common patterns
- Organization-specific template library
- Template marketplace for sharing

### Code Snippets
- Reusable code blocks that can be inserted into components
- Personal snippet library
- Team-shared snippets

### Dependency Viewer
- Visual graph showing which components depend on each other
- Impact analysis for changes
- Circular dependency detection

## 6. Performance & Analytics

### Usage Analytics
- Track which components are most/least used
- User engagement metrics
- Performance trends over time

### Performance Metrics
- Show render time for components
- Data fetch time tracking
- Memory usage monitoring
- Optimization suggestions

### Error Tracking
- Log and display component errors with frequency
- Error patterns and common issues
- Automated error reporting

## 7. Import/Export Enhancements

### Bulk Operations
- Import/export multiple components at once
- Batch updates to component metadata
- Bulk delete with confirmation

### Component Packages
- Export component with all dependencies
- Version-locked dependency exports
- Import validation and conflict resolution

### Format Support
- Import from different formats (JSON, YAML, TypeScript)
- Export to various targets (standalone app, embed code, etc.)
- Format conversion tools

## 8. Visual Improvements

### Grid/List Toggle
- Alternative grid view with larger preview cards
- Customizable card size
- Compact list view option

### Dark Mode
- Theme toggle for the entire dashboard
- Respect system preferences
- Custom theme creation

### Customizable Layout
- Drag to resize panels
- Save layout preferences per user
- Multiple layout presets

## 9. Additional Ideas

### AI-Powered Features
- Component recommendations based on usage
- Auto-generate components from descriptions
- Code completion and suggestions

### Component Marketplace
- Share components across organizations
- Component ratings and reviews
- Monetization options for creators

### Mobile Support
