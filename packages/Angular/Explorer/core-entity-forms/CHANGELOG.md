## 2.91.0

### Minor Changes

- 6476d74: migrations

### Patch Changes

- 6b77f80: Summary:
  feat: Add Action Result Codes management to Action form

  Detailed Description:
  Added complete CRUD functionality for managing Action Result Codes directly within the Action form component. Users can now add, edit, and
  delete result codes that define possible execution outcomes for Actions.

  Key Changes:
  - Created ActionResultCodeDialogComponent for adding/editing result codes with fields for code, description, and success status
  - Added interactive UI with hover effects, edit/delete buttons, and visual indicators for success/failure codes
  - Implemented proper transaction support using InternalSaveRecord pattern to save Action, Params, and Result Codes atomically
  - Fixed critical issue where loadResultCodes() was missing ResultType: 'entity_object', causing entity operations to fail
  - Updated PopulatePendingRecords to track Result Codes alongside Action Params for proper save/delete operations
  - Added Result Code management methods (addResultCode, editResultCode, deleteResultCode) following the same pattern as Action Params

  Impact:
  This enhancement allows developers to define and manage all possible result codes for their Actions directly in the UI, improving the Action
  development workflow and ensuring proper error handling patterns are documented.

## 2.76.0

### Minor Changes

- 4b27b3c: migration file so minor bump

### Patch Changes

- 7dabb22: feat: add hierarchical CategoryName support for query lookup

  Adds support for hierarchical category paths in query lookup operations.
  The CategoryName parameter now accepts filesystem-like paths (e.g.,
  "/MJ/AI/Agents/") that walk through the QueryCategory parent-child
  relationships.

  ### New Features
  - **Hierarchical Path Resolution**: CategoryName now supports paths like
    "/MJ/AI/Agents/" that are parsed by splitting on "/" and walking down the
    category hierarchy using ParentID relationships
  - **CategoryPath Property**: Added CategoryPath getter to QueryInfo class
    that returns the full hierarchical path for any query
  - **Backward Compatibility**: Existing simple CategoryName usage (e.g.,
    "Agents") continues to work unchanged

## 2.75.0

### Patch Changes

- 6a65fad: feat: Add AI Agent Run cost calculation with high-performance templated
  queries
  - Add AIAgentRunCostService with intelligent caching and single-query
    performance optimization
  - Implement CalculateAIAgentRunCost templated query using recursive CTE for
    hierarchical cost calculation
  - Fix GraphQL scalar type error (JSON → JSONObject) in RunQuery operations
  - Update AI Agent Run components to display consistent cost metrics in both
    top banner and analytics tab
  - Fix analytics component data loading to use proper entity relationships
    via AI Agent Run Steps
  - Add comprehensive metadata structure for AI queries with
    cross-environment schema compatibility
  - Remove debugging console statements for clean production output

  This enhancement provides accurate, performant cost tracking for AI Agent
  Runs including all nested sub-agent hierarchies up to 20 levels deep,
  replacing inefficient multiple database calls with a single optimized
  query.

Provides several advantages including the ability to easily upgrade functionality on forms and to conditionally render fields in their entirety only when needed (e.g. not show them at all when read only field and new record). _ Updated CodeGenLib to emit this new style of Angular Code _ Ran Code Gen (97354817+AN-BC@users.noreply.github.com)
