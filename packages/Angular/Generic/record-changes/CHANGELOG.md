### Patch Changes

- a3d6182: fix: a date-only (SQL `date`) column reads as its stored day in the query viewer, the record change history and restore preview, and the timeline, and exports as `YYYY-MM-DD`

  These paths still formatted a calendar day, which arrives as UTC midnight, in the reader's local zone, so a stored 2026-10-01 read as Sep 30 west of Greenwich: as "Sep 30, 2026" in a query viewer cell and row detail, as "Sep 30, 2026, 7:00 PM" in the change history, and in a "September 30" timeline segment. The query viewer now branches on `IsDateOnlySQLType` and formats with `FormatDateOnly`, and the row detail no longer adds an "hours ago" suffix to a day. The change history and the restore preview share one formatter, so a date-only field shows its day with no time, and the restore preview's live value for a date field is no longer blank. The timeline carries a date-only event as local midnight of its stored day, so its segments and labels land on that day. The export engine gains a `dateonly` column type: CSV and JSON write ISO 8601 `YYYY-MM-DD`, and Excel writes a date cell on the stored day. The entity grid and the query viewer mark SQL `date` columns with it, and the query viewer's export columns now set `dataType` (they set an ignored `type` key before).

  The entity viewer's Timeline view now reads its date field the same way: its rows are plain objects with no entity metadata, so the renderer hands the timeline group the entity (`TimelineGroup.EntityInfo`, used when a record carries none) and drops the time from the card date for a date-only field. The restore preview decides whether a field changed by value, not by its display string, so a timestamp that moved by under a minute is no longer reported unchanged and a snapshot day matches the same live day. The fallback export for Cards, Map and Timeline (the view workspace and Explorer's view resource) types its columns as the grid does, through a shared `ExportColumnTypeForSQLType`, so a date-only field exports as its day there too. The export engine writes a `dateonly` value whose leading `YYYY-MM-DD` is not a real day (`2026-13-45`, `2026-02-30`) as its original text instead of "Invalid Date" or a rolled-over day. The mobile app's entity explorer shows a date-only field in card subtitles and the record detail as its stored day. Closes MJ#4966.

## 6.2.0-edge.1

### Patch Changes

- 80905a1: Rename public class members and exported functions to PascalCase, per MJ's naming convention,
  **without breaking a single consumer**.

  Every renamed symbol keeps its old name beside the new one as a `@deprecated` stub that forwards to
  it — a delegating method or function, a getter/setter pair for a property, and for Angular a
  readable accessor pair for an `@Input` and a second `@Output` sharing the same `EventEmitter`, so a
  template still binding the old name keeps receiving events. Old names still compile, still resolve,
  and still behave identically; the deprecation tag rides through to the published `.d.ts`, so editors
  point callers at the replacement. Where a package re-exports through an explicit `export { … }`
  list, the new name is added alongside the old, so the correct name is actually on the public surface
  rather than merely declared.

  The rename is deliberately refused wherever a mechanical stub would not be equivalent, because
  several of those shapes change a type contract while still compiling in the package that declares
  them:
  - an **optional** property or parameter property — TypeScript has no optional accessor, so a stub
    would promote `foo?` to a required member and break every object literal that omits it;
  - a class that is a **data shape** (no methods, or `@ObjectType`/`@InputType`) — object literals are
    assigned to it, and an accessor stub changes what they must supply;
  - a property whose **subclass redeclares it**, since TypeScript forbids a property overriding an
    accessor (TS2610);
  - a name whose PascalCase form is **already bound** in that file or class;
  - decorated members, `get`/`set` pairs behind a decorator, generators, destructured parameters,
    overload sets and abstract members.

  **One wire-visible consequence, for version skew only.** `BaseInfo.toJSON` walks `_`-prefixed
  backing fields and emits them through their public getter, preferring the PascalCase one. Renaming
  the 23 field aliases in `MJCore/src/generic` therefore changes what `AllMetadata` carries:
  `EntityInfo.spCreate` and friends now serialize as `SpCreate`. A same-version client is unaffected —
  `copyInitData` accepts a value through a settable accessor, so either spelling lands on the right
  field. An OLDER client against a newer server has no such path in its `copyInitData` and drops those
  fields silently. Same-version deployments, which is the supported configuration, see no change.

  Each package was verified against its own pre-change baseline rather than against zero, because
  several packages in this repo do not typecheck cleanly to begin with. Angular packages were verified
  with `ngc`, not `tsc`: a plain typecheck does not compile templates, and an earlier write-only
  `@Input` alias passed `tsc` while breaking six template reads.

## 6.1.0

### Patch Changes

- b915983: Align the Angular toolchain on the current 21.x patch line: framework packages 21.1.3 → 21.2.22,
  CLI/builders 21.1.3 → 21.2.23, CDK 21.1.3 → 21.2.14, ng-packagr → 21.2.7, PrimeNG 21.1.1 → 21.1.9.

  This is a patch-level move inside the supported Angular 21 LTS line, not a framework migration.
  It closes every open Angular security advisory on the repository — fifteen distinct GHSAs
  (i18n and template-sanitizer XSS bypasses, service-worker header leakage and credential
  stripping, HttpTransferCache cross-request leakage, and formatDate/number-format DoS), all fixed
  in 21.2.19 or earlier — which together accounted for 438 of the 749 open Dependabot alerts.

  Every published `@memberjunction/ng-*` package's `@angular/*` peer range moves from `^21.1.3`
  (or `^21.0.0`) to `^21.2.22`, so consumers must be on at least that patch. The era-6 platform
  manifest in `release-lines.json` records the new pin; era 5 (the certified 5.51 line) is
  unchanged.

  Also moves the exact `@angular/*` runtime pins that 23 libraries carried in `dependencies`
  into caret `peerDependencies` (adding the missing peers on `ng-react`), so a consumer on any
  in-range Angular 21.2.x build gets a single Angular copy instead of a nested second runtime, and
  drops the unused `primeng` peer from `ng-base-forms` (nothing in the repo imports PrimeNG).

- b895f92: Angular DOM unit-testing — Phase 4 (gates, guardrails & spec hygiene). Dev-only; no runtime change.
  - **`test:types` spec type-check gate**: each DOM-testing package gains a
    `"test:types": "tsc --noEmit -p tsconfig.spec.json"` script, run as a cached turbo task in CI
    before the vitest suite (both the affected and full-suite paths). Closes the Phase-3 hole where
    vitest/esbuild's transpile-only path let real spec type errors (broken `import type` paths,
    `Subject`-vs-`EventEmitter`) ride green until the `ngc` build failed.
  - **DOM-spec placement guard** (`scripts/check-dom-spec-placement.mjs`, fast pre-build CI step):
    fails when a `*.dom.test.ts` sits inside `__tests__/`, where a dual-preset package silently runs
    it in neither vitest project. Its one real finding — `ng-markdown`'s service DOM spec — was
    relocated next to its source (test-file move only).
  - Fixes the pre-existing latent 2-args-of-3 `MCPDashboardComponent` constructor call in the
    dashboards node test (the gate's prerequisite).
  - **Anti-pattern lint** (`scripts/check-spec-antipatterns.mjs`, CI): bans vacuous assertions,
    skipped specs, blanket schemas, and `any`/`as never` casts in `*.dom.test.ts`. Enabling it drove
    the spec-hygiene cleanup across `ng-agent-requests` / `ng-query-viewer` / `ng-scheduling` /
    `ng-agents` / `ng-record-changes` (blanket schemas → explicit child stubs; `as never` → typed
    doubles) and the Explorer specs (real DOM clicks instead of handler calls, SVG prototype-patch
    teardown, typed context doubles).
  - **Explorer DOM coverage gate**: `classify-explorer-components.mjs --min 85` in CI — a testable
    Explorer component shipped without a DOM spec now fails the PR.

- 394d276: Declare @angular/\* peer dependencies as ranges (^21.1.3) instead of exact pins across all Angular library packages. Peer declarations are compatibility claims, not install instructions: the exact pins falsely claimed incompatibility with every other Angular 21.x build, produced 502 peer-resolution errors under strict pnpm workspaces, and structurally blocked Angular security patches behind a full republish. Installed versions remain pinned by consuming apps and the era platform manifest; dependencies/devDependencies keep their exact pins.

### Patch Changes

- 394d276: Declare @angular/\* peer dependencies as ranges (^21.1.3) instead of exact pins across all Angular library packages. Peer declarations are compatibility claims, not install instructions: the exact pins falsely claimed incompatibility with every other Angular 21.x build, produced 502 peer-resolution errors under strict pnpm workspaces, and structurally blocked Angular security patches behind a full republish. Installed versions remain pinned by consuming apps and the era platform manifest; dependencies/devDependencies keep their exact pins.

### Patch Changes

- b895f92: Angular DOM unit-testing — Phase 4 (gates, guardrails & spec hygiene). Dev-only; no runtime change.
  - **`test:types` spec type-check gate**: each DOM-testing package gains a
    `"test:types": "tsc --noEmit -p tsconfig.spec.json"` script, run as a cached turbo task in CI
    before the vitest suite (both the affected and full-suite paths). Closes the Phase-3 hole where
    vitest/esbuild's transpile-only path let real spec type errors (broken `import type` paths,
    `Subject`-vs-`EventEmitter`) ride green until the `ngc` build failed.
  - **DOM-spec placement guard** (`scripts/check-dom-spec-placement.mjs`, fast pre-build CI step):
    fails when a `*.dom.test.ts` sits inside `__tests__/`, where a dual-preset package silently runs
    it in neither vitest project. Its one real finding — `ng-markdown`'s service DOM spec — was
    relocated next to its source (test-file move only).
  - Fixes the pre-existing latent 2-args-of-3 `MCPDashboardComponent` constructor call in the
    dashboards node test (the gate's prerequisite).
  - **Anti-pattern lint** (`scripts/check-spec-antipatterns.mjs`, CI): bans vacuous assertions,
    skipped specs, blanket schemas, and `any`/`as never` casts in `*.dom.test.ts`. Enabling it drove
    the spec-hygiene cleanup across `ng-agent-requests` / `ng-query-viewer` / `ng-scheduling` /
    `ng-agents` / `ng-record-changes` (blanket schemas → explicit child stubs; `as never` → typed
    doubles) and the Explorer specs (real DOM clicks instead of handler calls, SVG prototype-patch
    teardown, typed context doubles).
  - **Explorer DOM coverage gate**: `classify-explorer-components.mjs --min 85` in CI — a testable
    Explorer component shipped without a DOM spec now fails the PR.

## 5.44.0

### Patch Changes

- 0476455: Migrate inline empty-state placeholders to the canonical `<mj-empty-state>` component across Explorer and Generic Angular packages (UI-consistency objective O4), wiring the component into the packages that needed it (and adding `@memberjunction/ng-ui-components` as a dependency where missing). Also fixes reset-filter CTA correctness in three picker dialogs (sub-agent selector, add-action, action gallery) where the handler cleared only a subset of the active filter dimensions, and refines the UI adoption measurement script with a transparent three-tier empty-state count (raw widened → non-placeholder false-positives → wrappers-around-migrated → genuine).

## 5.39.0

### Patch Changes

- 3b29882: feat: render any entity form as a tab, dialog, or slide-in (Generic, no regeneration)

  Adds a presentation-agnostic form stack to `@memberjunction/ng-base-forms`:
  - **`MjEntityFormHostComponent`** — headless host that resolves the form
    (generated / custom / interactive override + variants), loads the record,
    dynamically creates + binds the form, re-emits its events, and tears down.
    Extracted from Explorer's `SingleRecordComponent`, which is now a thin wrapper.
  - **`MjFormDialogComponent` / `MjFormSlideInComponent`** + **`MJFormPresenterService`**
    — declarative and imperative ways to open any entity form as a modal dialog or
    slide-in panel.
  - **`EntityFormConfig`** + presets — per-instance control over toolbar visibility,
    related-entity sections, section collapsibility, width, and in-form navigation.
    Applied via the form reference so existing generated forms honor it **without
    regeneration**.
  - **`FormResolverService`** moved from `ng-explorer-core` into `ng-base-forms`
    (it had no Explorer/Router coupling), making the interactive-form + variant
    pathway first-class on every surface.
  - **`MjSlidePanelComponent`** relocated from `ng-versions` into `ng-ui-components`
    as a first-class shared primitive; `ng-versions` and the other consumers
    (record-changes, record-tags, entity-viewer, dashboards, core-entity-forms) now
    import it from there.

  Phase-1 consumer migrations: the Query Categories create flow now uses
  `<mj-form-dialog>`, and editing the selected category uses `MJFormPresenterService`
  slide-in — replacing the bespoke `query-category-dialog`.

## 5.12.0

### Patch Changes

- a57b8d5: Migrate all hardcoded CSS colors to design tokens for dark mode and white-label support. Introduces `--mj-*` semantic CSS custom properties in `_tokens.scss` with full `[data-theme="dark"]` overrides. Migrates 1,544 of 1,659 hardcoded hex values (93%) across 72+ CSS files to semantic tokens. Adds logo token system (`--mj-logo-mark`, `--mj-logo-color`) for themeable branding. Fixes dark mode theming for CodeMirror, AG Grid v35, and Kendo popups. No API or behavioral changes — CSS only.
