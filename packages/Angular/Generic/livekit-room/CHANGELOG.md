### Minor Changes

- 9f6aa87: Generic fire-and-forget save queue, realtime multi-agent floor control, and telemetry fixes.

  **Generic fire-and-forget save queue** (`@memberjunction/global`, `@memberjunction/core`, + adopters) — de-duplicates the hand-rolled "INSERT (fire-and-forget) → chained UPDATE" persistence pattern and makes the "stuck at Running" race structurally impossible:
  - `KeyedSerialTaskQueue` (`@memberjunction/global`) — entity-agnostic per-key serial task chain: same-key tasks serialize, different keys run concurrently, failures are tallied for `flush()` and never propagate. Self-bounding (in-flight set + failure counters), so a long-lived queue that never flushes doesn't grow.
  - `BaseEntitySaveQueue` (`@memberjunction/core`) — entity façade: `Insert` / `Update(entity, applyMutation?)` / `Flush`, with an optional `onError` hook for structured logging. `Update`'s mutation runs _inside_ the post-INSERT task, so it can never be reverted by the INSERT's reload.
  - Adopted in all three hand-rolled copies + the new consumer: `GenericProcessRunTracker` (`@memberjunction/record-set-processor`), `AgentRunStepSaveQueue` (`@memberjunction/ai-core-plus`), `ActionEngine`'s execution log (`@memberjunction/actions`), and `AIPromptRunner` / `AIModelRunner` (`@memberjunction/ai-prompts`). Also fixes a pre-existing `MJLruCache` mock gap in the Actions/Engine test suite.

  **Realtime** (`@memberjunction/ai`, `@memberjunction/ai-bridge-server`, `@memberjunction/ai-gemini`, `@memberjunction/ai-openai`, `@memberjunction/livekit-room-server`, `@memberjunction/ng-livekit-room`) — multi-agent floor control, Gemini meeting mode, the session capability surface with first-agent re-gating, and an idle reaper.

  **Telemetry / core** (`@memberjunction/core`, `@memberjunction/server`) — cacheability-aware duplicate-RunView suggestion for `AllowCaching=false` entities; fixes the telemetry pagination-fingerprint false-duplicate and batches the janitor channel reads.

### Patch Changes

- 54183aa: Add the Angular DOM unit-testing foundation: a new `@memberjunction/ng-test-utils` package providing `renderComponentFixture` (standalone/leaf components) and `renderTemplate` (compound / module-declared components) helpers, the Vitest + jsdom DOM-testing harness, coverage reporting in the DOM preset, a `scaffold-tests.mjs --dom` flag (with a spaces-in-path fix), and DOM specs across `ng-ui-components`, `ng-pagination`, `ng-tabstrip`, and `ng-livekit-room`.

  `ng-livekit-room` is the headline pilot (now that PR #2860 is on `next`): DOM specs for the media-free leaf components (`control-bar`, `agent-state`, `connection-overlay`, `chat-panel`, `device-menu`) plus `participant-tile` as the §7 media-split worked example — the media-free surface is tested while `track.attach()` and the audio-meter `requestAnimationFrame` loop are left to live tests — on a dual node+dom preset that preserves the package's existing logic specs. The `LiveKitRoomComponent` injectable-controller refactor (the one production-code change) is deferred to the Phase 2 component rollout; the injected-fake-container pattern it would prove is already demonstrated via the `providers` seam.

  Also hardens the harness wiring flagged in review: correct `@memberjunction/ng-test-utils` devDependency declarations (`ng-tabstrip`, `ng-livekit-room`) and Turbo cache inputs covering `tsconfig.spec.json` + the root shared-harness files. Code-only, no schema changes.

## 5.42.0

### Minor Changes

- 5fde509: Add the LiveKit room UX stack — a full-featured, framework-portable LiveKit client plus the MJ realtime-bridge binding, server token/egress support, and an Explorer surface.
  - **`@memberjunction/livekit-room-core`** (new): framework-agnostic pure-TS room controller over `livekit-client` — observable room state, participants, active speakers, audio meters, device control, data-channel messages, audio-autoplay unblock, Krisp noise filter, background blur/virtual background, E2EE, room-free media preview, and a deep **cancelable event architecture** (`event.Cancel = true`).
  - **`@memberjunction/ng-livekit-room`** (new): super-featured portable Angular UI (`mj-livekit-room`) — gallery / active-speaker / **split-view (draggable splitter)** / audio-only layouts with a live switcher, A/V/screen controls, data-channel chat, device + settings menu (noise filter / background blur), **PreJoin lobby**, **StartAudio** unblock, click-to-pin, **agent-state visualizer**, **collaborative whiteboard** (reuses `@memberjunction/ng-whiteboard`, synced over the data channel — agent co-authoring supported), recording control, and E2EE. Every feature gated by a PascalCase `@Input`; core events re-surfaced as `@Output`s. MJ design tokens with fallbacks.
  - **`@memberjunction/livekit-room-server`** (new): scoped client/bot token minting (`livekit-server-sdk`), `LiveKitAgentRoomCoordinator` session-start harness (opens a realtime session → `AIBridgeEngine.StartBridgeSession`), and `LiveKitEgressService` recording.
  - **`@memberjunction/ng-mj-livekit-room`** (new): MJ binding (`mj-livekit-agent-room`) resolving tokens / starting agent sessions / recording via the RealtimeBridge GraphQL surface.
  - **`@memberjunction/graphql-dataprovider`**: adds `GraphQLLiveKitClient` (mint token, start agent room session, start/stop recording).
  - **`@memberjunction/server`**: adds `RealtimeBridgeResolver` (`MintLiveKitClientToken`, `StartLiveKitAgentRoomSession`, `StartLiveKitRecording`, `StopLiveKitRecording`).
  - **`@memberjunction/ng-explorer-core`**: registers a `LiveKitRoomResource` so the room can be opened as an Explorer tab.

  Tests: 74 unit tests across the stack (core 22, server 15, ng-livekit-room 26, GraphQL client 6, resolver 5). No migrations. The agent-talking path additionally requires the deployment to bind a realtime-session factory on `LiveKitAgentRoomCoordinator.Instance` and the LiveKit native room client (`@livekit/rtc-node`) — the documented deployment seams.

- 4ec1732: Make the Meet app's LiveKit Live Room work end-to-end (default agent resolution, realtime model fallback, real backing session row, bridge-driver registration, connect timeout, and active device selection), then build it into a multi-party experience: a pre-join agent picker, threading a target agent so the co-agent actually responds, in-room add/remove of agents, and shareable human invite links. Also improves Entity Vector Sync with a concise per-document summary, verbose-gated pipeline logging, and a batched Entity Record Document existence read that replaces an N+1 query storm.
