## 5.43.0

### Patch Changes

- 54183aa: Add the Angular DOM unit-testing foundation: a new `@memberjunction/ng-test-utils` package providing `renderComponentFixture` (standalone/leaf components) and `renderTemplate` (compound / module-declared components) helpers, the Vitest + jsdom DOM-testing harness, coverage reporting in the DOM preset, a `scaffold-tests.mjs --dom` flag (with a spaces-in-path fix), and DOM specs across `ng-ui-components`, `ng-pagination`, `ng-tabstrip`, and `ng-livekit-room`.

  `ng-livekit-room` is the headline pilot (now that PR #2860 is on `next`): DOM specs for the media-free leaf components (`control-bar`, `agent-state`, `connection-overlay`, `chat-panel`, `device-menu`) plus `participant-tile` as the §7 media-split worked example — the media-free surface is tested while `track.attach()` and the audio-meter `requestAnimationFrame` loop are left to live tests — on a dual node+dom preset that preserves the package's existing logic specs. The `LiveKitRoomComponent` injectable-controller refactor (the one production-code change) is deferred to the Phase 2 component rollout; the injected-fake-container pattern it would prove is already demonstrated via the `providers` seam.

  Also hardens the harness wiring flagged in review: correct `@memberjunction/ng-test-utils` devDependency declarations (`ng-tabstrip`, `ng-livekit-room`) and Turbo cache inputs covering `tsconfig.spec.json` + the root shared-harness files. Code-only, no schema changes.

### Patch Changes

- b03bfb4: Replace hardcoded colors with semantic design tokens across Angular components and shared styles, restoring correct dark-mode behavior and enabling white-labeling. Also maps the System Diagnostics PerfMon chrome (background, borders, text, controls) to MJ semantic tokens so the panel adapts to the active theme; series colors stay categorical.
- 7d8a0f9: Bound memory leaks: ResultHistory cap, QueueBase Stop/ IShutdownable, A2AServer, TaskStore, sweep, MJLruCache for provider / issuer caches, BaseLLM streaming reset, ShutdownRegister + SIGTERM contract.

### Minor Changes

- 05f19ff: Add composable query system with semantic catalog search, CTE composition engine, server-side paging, query caching with TTL/dependency invalidation, and agent directive surfacing. Includes QueryCacheManager wrapper over LocalCacheManager, QueryPagingEngine for SQL-level OFFSET/FETCH paging, QueryCompositionEngine for platform-aware CTE generation, and SearchQueryCatalog action for vector-based query discovery. Renames PaginationComponent to DataPagerComponent and extracts into shared module.
