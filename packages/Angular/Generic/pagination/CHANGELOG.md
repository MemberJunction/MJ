### Patch Changes

- b915983: Align the Angular toolchain on the current 21.x patch line: framework packages 21.1.3 → 21.2.22,
  CLI/builders 21.1.3 → 21.2.23, CDK 21.1.3 → 21.2.14, ng-packagr → 21.2.7, PrimeNG 21.1.1 → 21.1.9.

  This is a patch-level move inside the supported Angular 21 LTS line, not a framework migration.
  It closes every open Angular security advisory on the repository — fifteen distinct GHSAs
  (i18n and template-sanitizer XSS bypasses, service-worker header leakage and credential
  stripping, HttpTransferCache cross-request leakage, and formatDate/number-format DoS), all fixed
  in 21.2.19 or earlier — which together accounted for 438 of the 749 open Dependabot alerts.

  Every published `@memberjunction/ng-*` package's `@angular/*` peer range moves from `^21.1.3`
  (or `^21.0.0`) to `^21.2.22`, so consumers must be on at least that patch. The era-6 platform
  manifest in `release-lines.json` records the new pin; era 5 (the certified 5.51 line) is
  unchanged.

  Also moves the exact `@angular/*` runtime pins that 23 libraries carried in `dependencies`
  into caret `peerDependencies` (adding the missing peers on `ng-react`), so a consumer on any
  in-range Angular 21.2.x build gets a single Angular copy instead of a nested second runtime, and
  drops the unused `primeng` peer from `ng-base-forms` (nothing in the repo imports PrimeNG).

### Patch Changes

- 394d276: Declare @angular/\* peer dependencies as ranges (^21.1.3) instead of exact pins across all Angular library packages. Peer declarations are compatibility claims, not install instructions: the exact pins falsely claimed incompatibility with every other Angular 21.x build, produced 502 peer-resolution errors under strict pnpm workspaces, and structurally blocked Angular security patches behind a full republish. Installed versions remain pinned by consuming apps and the era platform manifest; dependencies/devDependencies keep their exact pins.

### Patch Changes

- 54183aa: Add the Angular DOM unit-testing foundation: a new `@memberjunction/ng-test-utils` package providing `renderComponentFixture` (standalone/leaf components) and `renderTemplate` (compound / module-declared components) helpers, the Vitest + jsdom DOM-testing harness, coverage reporting in the DOM preset, a `scaffold-tests.mjs --dom` flag (with a spaces-in-path fix), and DOM specs across `ng-ui-components`, `ng-pagination`, `ng-tabstrip`, and `ng-livekit-room`.

  `ng-livekit-room` is the headline pilot (now that PR #2860 is on `next`): DOM specs for the media-free leaf components (`control-bar`, `agent-state`, `connection-overlay`, `chat-panel`, `device-menu`) plus `participant-tile` as the §7 media-split worked example — the media-free surface is tested while `track.attach()` and the audio-meter `requestAnimationFrame` loop are left to live tests — on a dual node+dom preset that preserves the package's existing logic specs. The `LiveKitRoomComponent` injectable-controller refactor (the one production-code change) is deferred to the Phase 2 component rollout; the injected-fake-container pattern it would prove is already demonstrated via the `providers` seam.

  Also hardens the harness wiring flagged in review: correct `@memberjunction/ng-test-utils` devDependency declarations (`ng-tabstrip`, `ng-livekit-room`) and Turbo cache inputs covering `tsconfig.spec.json` + the root shared-harness files. Code-only, no schema changes.

### Patch Changes

- b03bfb4: Replace hardcoded colors with semantic design tokens across Angular components and shared styles, restoring correct dark-mode behavior and enabling white-labeling. Also maps the System Diagnostics PerfMon chrome (background, borders, text, controls) to MJ semantic tokens so the panel adapts to the active theme; series colors stay categorical.
- 7d8a0f9: Bound memory leaks: ResultHistory cap, QueueBase Stop/ IShutdownable, A2AServer, TaskStore, sweep, MJLruCache for provider / issuer caches, BaseLLM streaming reset, ShutdownRegister + SIGTERM contract.

### Minor Changes

- 05f19ff: Add composable query system with semantic catalog search, CTE composition engine, server-side paging, query caching with TTL/dependency invalidation, and agent directive surfacing. Includes QueryCacheManager wrapper over LocalCacheManager, QueryPagingEngine for SQL-level OFFSET/FETCH paging, QueryCompositionEngine for platform-aware CTE generation, and SearchQueryCatalog action for vector-based query discovery. Renames PaginationComponent to DataPagerComponent and extracts into shared module.
