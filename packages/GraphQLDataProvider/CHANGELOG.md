### Minor Changes

- ae5cfbd: Search Scopes & RAG+ — multi-phase ship

  A bundled feature release across the search pipeline (Phases 2A–6 of
  the Search Scopes & RAG+ initiative). Highlights:

  **SearchEngine pipeline**
  - New `SimpleVectorDatabase` in-process driver — points
    `VectorDBBase` at any entity column with an `EmbeddingVector`
    field. Suitable for dev / agent-memory / small-medium corpora.
    Constructor accepts an empty/missing API key (in-process driver
    has no remote auth target).
  - `VectorDBBase.QueryIndex(params, contextUser?)` — `contextUser`
    is now a proper second parameter instead of being smuggled
    through `filter.__contextUser`. Pinecone/Qdrant/pgvector ignore
    it (they auth via API key); in-process drivers use it for
    RunView's server-side RLS guard. Method-level pattern matches
    MJ's `RunView(params, contextUser)` and `GetEntityObject(name,
contextUser)` conventions.
  - `SearchFusion` — multi-provider score evidence is now preserved
    through RRF. Previously the second provider's `ScoreBreakdown`
    contribution was silently dropped when the same RecordID
    appeared in two provider lists, causing the merged item to
    rank below single-provider hits. Records that match in
    Vector + Entity now carry both contributions and rank
    correctly.
  - Defensive sanitation in `Fuse()` — items with non-finite Score
    (NaN, Infinity), empty/non-string RecordID, or null payloads are
    filtered before fusion. Closes a class of failure modes from
    misbehaving 3rd-party providers.
  - Tier-1 input edge cases hardened — null/undefined/non-string
    Query no longer TypeErrors, surfaces a clean Failure result.
    `EntitySearchProvider` now strips SQL LIKE wildcards (`%`, `_`,
    `[`, `]`) from user input — `Query="%"` no longer matches every
    row through the LIKE-injection vector.
  - Streaming search — `SearchEngine.streamSearch()` v2 emits
    provider events as soon as each provider promise settles
    (concurrent emission), not in registration order.

  **Permission gate (Phase 2A)**
  - `SearchScopePermissionResolver` enforces a 6-step decision tree:
    AgentNone → AgentAssignedNotListed → DirectGrant → RoleGrant →
    AgentUnscopedAll → NoGrant.
  - `AIAgent.SearchScopeAccess` enum (`'None' | 'All' | 'Assigned'`)
    controls agent-side fallback when no per-user/per-role grant
    applies. `BypassCache` propagates through the dedup-linger cache
    so freshly-revoked grants take effect immediately.
  - New tests + agent scenarios cover all 13 permission-matrix cells
    (PM-01..PM-13).

  **Reranker catalog (Phase 2D)**
  - 4 reranker drivers — Cohere, Voyage, OpenAI judge, BGE local —
    all with `@RegisterClass(BaseReRanker, ...)`. Per-search
    `RerankerBudgetGuard` caps API spend; `EstimateCostCents` and
    `CostReporter` per driver. Graceful degradation when the
    upstream SDK rejects/times out/returns malformed responses.

  **Observability (Phase 3)**
  - `MJSearchExecutionLog` — every `Search()` invocation writes one
    row with Status / ResultCount / TotalDurationMs / RerankerCostCents
    / ProvidersJSON (per-source hit counts) / AIAgentID attribution.
    Forbidden gate decisions log `Status='Forbidden'` rows.
  - Knowledge Hub Config dashboard subtab visualizes the log:
    hit-rate, p50/p95 latency, top failure reasons, top users, total
    reranker cost.

  **External providers (Phase 5)**
  - 4 search providers — Elasticsearch, Typesense, Azure AI Search,
    OpenSearch — all with `@RegisterClass(BaseSearchProvider, ...)`.
  - New `AvailableSearchProviders` GraphQL query exposes the
    `BaseSearchProvider.GetAvailableProviders()` runtime catalog to
    the SearchScope form's provider dropdown (P5.5).

  **Angular / UI**
  - Custom `MJSearchScopeFormComponentExtended` (P2D.7 / P4) — fusion
    weights sliders, reranker dropdown, live-preview panel, A/B
    Kendall-tau similarity, CSV export of last 500 invocations.
  - Custom `MJSearchScopeProviderFormComponentExtended` (P5.5) —
    provider dropdown sourced from `MJ: Search Providers` rows,
    annotated with whether each provider's DriverClass is currently
    registered with the server's ClassFactory.
  - Streaming search consumer in `SearchService.StreamSearch()` —
    Angular Observable surface for the `StreamScopedSearch`
    mutation + `SearchStreamEvents` subscription.

  **Migration**
  - `V202605081416__v5.34.x__Search_Scopes_And_RAG_Plus.sql` —
    consolidated. Contains six DDL sections (Phase 1 baseline,
    `SearchScopePermission`, `SearchScope.RerankerBudgetCents`,
    `SearchExecutionLog`, `SearchScopeTestQuery`, unique-constraint
    fix) followed by five CodeGen runs that regenerate the entity
    metadata, sprocs, views, and permission grants for all of the
    above.

  **Test suite**
  - 17 end-to-end agent scenarios (s01–s17) under `agent-scenarios/`,
    driving real LLM tool-calls (Sage agent) against the SearchEngine
    - multi-provider RRF + reranker pipeline. 95 assertions; all PASS.
  - `@memberjunction/search-engine` vitest: 237 unit tests across 21
    files, all PASS. Covers fusion, providers (real + external),
    rerankers, scope template renderer, parent-ID metadata,
    streaming, permission resolver, edge cases, mid-flight failures.

  **Documentation**
  - `guides/SEARCH_SCOPES_AND_RAG_GUIDE.md` — comprehensive guide
    covering scope creation, agent integration, permission resolution,
    multi-scope fusion, reranker catalog, observability, external
    providers, how-to templates for adding a new provider /
    reranker / artifact tool library / vector index over an
    embedded entity column. Documents the embedding-regeneration
    contract for ops.

  See `RAG_plan.md` for the full multi-phase plan and `plans/
search-scopes-rag-plus/what-we-built.md` for the customer-facing
  summary.

### Patch Changes

- cfffb6d: Add keyset (seek) pagination to `RunView` via the new `RunViewParams.AfterKey: CompositeKey` field. Iterating large entities (background jobs, scheduled actions, bulk processing) now stays O(log N) per page regardless of depth — `StartRow`-based OFFSET pagination is unchanged and remains the right choice for UI grids.

  **Framework changes**
  - New `RunViewParams.AfterKey: CompositeKey` accepted by all RunView entry points (TS, GraphQL, REST flows that go through RunView).
  - New exported error class `AfterKeyNotSupportedError` (with `Reason` codes `CompositePK | UnsupportedPKType | IncompatibleOrderBy | StartRowConflict | AfterKeyShape`).
  - New exported helper `IsKeysetPaginationOrderableType(sqlType)` and constant `KEYSET_PAGINATION_ORDERABLE_PK_TYPES`.
  - Keyset queries bypass server cache (read + write) automatically — they're inherently single-use so caching is pure overhead.
  - v1 constraint: single-column PK only. Composite-PK entities throw `AfterKeyNotSupportedError` with `Reason: 'CompositePK'`.

  **Migrated callers (now use keyset by default when entity has a single-column PK)**
  - `ScheduledGeocodingAction` (`processMissingForEntity`) — falls back to OFFSET on composite-PK entities.
  - `VectorBase.PageRecordsByEntityID` + `EntityVectorSyncer.startDataPaging` — auto-promotes to keyset when possible. New helper `VectorBase.CanUseKeysetPagination()`. New optional `PageRecordsParams.AfterKey`.

  **Metadata**
  - `Geocoding Maintenance` scheduled job cron updated to weekly (Saturdays 2 AM UTC); description reworded to not hard-code a cadence. Administrators can adjust the `CronExpression` as needed.

  **Documentation**
  - New guide: `guides/KEYSET_PAGINATION_GUIDE.md`.
  - `CLAUDE.md` performance section updated.

  **Out of scope for v1**
  - `ExternalChangeDetection.ChangeDetector` uses `RunQuery` (saved queries with arbitrary SQL), which the framework can't safely rewrite. Stays on OFFSET; tracked as a follow-up.

  **Backwards compatibility**
  - Fully additive. Existing callers that don't pass `AfterKey` are unaffected.

- e999e0d: Add cross-server cache invalidation via shared storage provider, fix "No Applications Available" after browser refresh, use cacheSettings.verboseLogging for Redis provider, add ParameterHints to override LLM-generated sampleValues, and thread forceRefresh as BypassCache through BaseEngine config loading

## 5.33.0

### Minor Changes

- 97ed790: feat(explorer): Identity Card profile dialog + Admin app reorganization + Developer Tools suite

  **Profile dialog (replaces legacy Settings)** — A focused single-pane Identity Card with slide-in panels for photo and theme editing, functional notification channel toggles (saved via UserInfoEngine), role chips, account info, and sign-out. Drops the redundant Apps tab and the dead Appearance placeholder.

  **About MemberJunction dialog** — Added to the avatar menu's System group. Shows the framework version, three quick stats (entities/applications/queries), the connected user, a "Connected to <host>" line, and an expandable diagnostics section with a copy-to-clipboard helper. A small "MemberJunction · v<version>" line is also shown on the loading screen.

  **User-menu cleanup** — Removed the Toggle Developer Mode / Log Layout (Debug) / Inspect App State items. The two debug items had richer replacements as full dashboards in Admin → Developer Tools. `DeveloperModeService` itself remains for future per-record dev affordances.

  **Admin app reorganization (10 → 4 top-nav)** — Each top-nav item is now a container resource that owns its own left-nav of sub-sections via dynamic component instantiation, with URL deep-linking through NavigationService (`?section=<id>`). Containers detach + reattach sub-component views instead of destroying them, so Event Monitor's capture, GraphQL Console history, scroll positions, and search inputs persist across switches.
  - **Identity & Access**: Users · Roles · Apps · App Roles · Permissions · API Keys
  - **Data & Schema**: ERD · Query Browser · Database Designer
  - **Monitoring**: Diagnostics · SQL Logging
  - **Developer Tools**: GraphQL Console · Event Monitor · Class Registry · Lazy Loading · Settings Explorer · App State · Layout

  **Developer Tools suite (7 inspectors)**:
  - **GraphQL Console** with `mj-code-editor` (graphql + json syntax highlighting), three-tab sidebar (History · Entities · Schema), introspection-driven Schema explorer that detects introspection-disabled and renders a clean lock-icon panel instead of a stack trace, Entities tab listing every `Metadata.Provider.Entities` with metadata-driven CRUD/RunView template generation (uses `getGraphQLTypeNameBase` + `FieldMapper.MapFieldName` so `__mj_*` columns are correctly emitted as `_mj__*` with inline comments), query history with favorites and copy-as-cURL, resizable vertical + horizontal splitters, default replace / shift-click append insertion behavior, Cmd/Ctrl+Enter to run.
  - **Event Monitor** with replay-enabled live tail (`GetEventListener(true)`), sortable column headers, distinct-attribute dropdown filters (Type / Component / Code), pulse indicator, pause/resume/clear, empty-payload-aware expansion.
  - **Class Registry** browser grouped by base class with priority + winner/shadowed badges to surface override conflicts at a glance.
  - **Lazy Loading** chunk inspector with progress bar, filter chips, expandable cards listing the registrations a chunk brings in, and a Force Load button to preload a chunk on demand.
  - **Settings Explorer** for `MJ: User Settings` + `MJ: Instance Configurations` with type detection, JSON-aware previews, and a split detail pane.
  - **App State Inspector** + **Layout Inspector** — read-only JSON viewers using `mj-code-editor` with refresh / copy / download actions.

  All Developer Tools preferences persist per-user via `UserInfoEngine` under the `MJ.DevTools.<scope>` key prefix — search inputs, dropdown selections, sort order, expanded groups, splitter sizes, GraphQL query history, and active sub-sections.

  **Other**:
  - Re-exported `PACKAGE_VERSION` from `@memberjunction/graphql-dataprovider`'s public API for use in About + loading screen.
  - Extended `LazyModuleRegistry` with public `GetSnapshot()` + `ForceLoad()` methods + globalThis publish so diagnostic tools in `ng-dashboards` can introspect lazy state without creating a hard package dependency on `ng-explorer-core`.
  - Added Dialog Button Placement convention to `packages/Angular/CLAUDE.md` (Save / Submit on the LEFT, Cancel on the RIGHT — opposite of the Windows convention).
  - Admin app metadata (`.admin-application.json`) updated to the new 4-item top-nav structure.

## 5.31.0

### Minor Changes

- fc8b9b8: Autotagger scope & governance — per-tenant tag scoping, per-tag governance, persisted embeddings, suggestion queue, Tag Health, and a unified Tag Governance dashboard with full UI.

  **Schema (one additive migration `V202605010846`)** — 9 new columns on `__mj.Tag` (governance + persisted embedding cache), three new tables (`__mj.TagScope` polymorphic M2M, `__mj.TagSynonym`, `__mj.TagSuggestion` review queue). Existing rows default to `IsGlobal=1` so behavior is unchanged out of the box. `IContentSourceConfiguration` JSON type extended with five net-new optional knobs (`SuggestThreshold`, `MaxNewTagsPerRun`, `MaxNewTagsPerItem`, `MaxTokensPerRun`, `MaxCostPerRun`) — CodeGen emits the typed accessor.

  **Engine (`tag-engine` / `tag-engine-base` / `core-entities-server`)** — `MJTagEntityServer` + new `MJTagScopeEntityServer` enforce the `IsGlobal ⊕ TagScope` invariant via `ValidateAsync` (no DB triggers); persisted-embedding `Save()` hook + cold-start hydrate path replace the every-startup recompute. `TagEngineBase` eagerly loads scope + synonyms in `Config()` and exposes `GetVisibleTags / GetTagBySynonym / GetTagByName(name, ctx) / GetTaxonomyTree(rootID, ctx)`. New `TagScopeFilterBuilder` (`BaseSingleton`) produces SQL fragments + in-memory predicates + child-scope subset validator. `TagEngine.ResolveTag` widened with a `'hybrid'` mode and a `ResolveTagOptions` parameter — new 4+1-tier pipeline (synonym → exact → fuzzy → semantic with tiered confidence routing → governance-gated `handleNoMatch`). `SuggestThreshold` band routes to the suggestion queue; `createAndEmbedTag` snapshots parent scope onto new children when parent is non-global. `TagGovernanceEngine` adds `ValidateAutoGrow / EnqueueSuggestion / PromoteSuggestion / RejectSuggestion`; `MergeTags` carries source synonyms (`Source='Merged'`). New `TagHealthJob` with three idempotent emitters (merge / low-usage / wide-node), gated by `MJ_AUTOTAG_RUN_TAG_HEALTH=1` env or invokable on demand. New `TagEngine.RebuildTagEmbeddings(contextUser)` utility for post-model-change rebuilds.

  **Autotag pipeline (`content-autotagging`)** — `ScopeContextResolver` derives per-source scope from `TagRootID`, `RunBudget` enforces per-run + per-item caps, new `OnAfterBatch` hook on `AutotagBaseEngine` gracefully pauses runs via the existing `CancellationRequested` machinery. `BridgeContentItemTagToTaxonomy` threads `scopeContext`, `SuggestThreshold`, source traceability, and an `onTagCreated` callback into `ResolveTag`. Per-item budget exhaustion collapses the effective mode to `hybrid` so further new tags route to suggestions instead of being auto-created.

  **Server (`server` / `graphql-dataprovider`)** — new `TagGovernanceResolver` exposes `PromoteTagSuggestion` / `RejectTagSuggestion` / `RebuildTagEmbeddings` / `RunTagHealth` mutations so suggestion dispositions run transactionally on the server. Matching `GraphQLAIClient` methods + result interfaces.

  **UI (`ng-dashboards` / `ng-core-entity-forms`)** — new `TagGovernanceResourceComponent` (registered as `'TagGovernance'`) — single dashboard with **left-nav** (top nav stays with the MJExplorer shell). Three sections built to the picked mockup options: Taxonomy (Option A — tree + governance/scope/synonyms detail-form, scope dialog with parent-subset validation), Suggestions (Option C — table + drawer with bulk actions and "if approved" preview), Tag Health (Option A — three summary cards + threshold tuning + run history + Rebuild stale embeddings). `MJContentSourceFormComponentExtended` gains a "Tag Pipeline Configuration" panel (Option B dense form) with mode picker cards, threshold sliders that auto-keep `SuggestThreshold < MatchThreshold`, scope+root, and budget fields — the existing JSON code editor stays available collapsed below as the advanced override. Multi-provider safe + UUID-compliant throughout.

  **Tests** — 271 tests across the impacted packages, all green. New: 12 `TagScopeFilterBuilder`, 8 `ValidateAutoGrow`, 4 `TagHealthJob`, 7 `RunBudget`, 8 `ScopeContextResolver`, 18 `TagGovernanceResolver`, 18 `TagGovernance` dashboard, 23 `ContentSource` form (vitest newly enabled in `ng-core-entity-forms`).

  **Documentation** — `guides/TAXONOMY_TAGGING_GUIDE.md` (~730 lines, 7 Mermaid diagrams) covers the entity model, autotag pipeline, 4+1-tier resolver, taxonomy modes, governance gates, scope inheritance, suggestion lifecycle, worked implementation guides, seeding patterns, and ops guidance. `guides/BASE_ENTITY_SERVER_PATTERNS.md` captures the persisted-embedding + `ValidateAsync` invariant + FK-cleanup-before-delete patterns this PR introduces so future agents lift the recipe rather than re-discover it. `mockups/knowledge-hub-classify-redesign/` ships 12 polished HTML mockups (3 options each across the 3 high-priority surfaces) that drove the UX direction.

  Migration ordering: apply the SQL migration → run CodeGen → `mj sync push` for the JSON-type interface → build. The migration is additive and idempotent against `IsGlobal=1` defaults; existing customers see no behavior change until they opt in by setting per-tag governance flags or moving sources off the default `auto-grow` mode.

- 17b8087: no migration but marking as minor due to cache bump stuff added here, good practice, but we're on a minor bump anyway

### Patch Changes

- 7ed7a4b: no metadata/migration changes
- de34786: Add `GetItems<T>(keys, category?)` batched read to `ILocalStorageProvider`. IndexedDB implementation uses a single read transaction with N parallel `get()` calls; Redis uses one `MGET` command. Used internally by `LocalCacheManager.GetRunViewResults` to batch the smart-cache-check warm-load reads (eliminating ~85 sequential per-key IDB transactions per coalesced engine bundle), the dataset-cache load (eliminating 3 redundant data-key reads per cached dataset access), and the metadata-snapshot bootstrap (3 keys → 1 batched read). Also fixes `IsDatasetCached` to probe via the tiny `_date` key instead of pulling the multi-MB dataset blob just for an existence check. No on-disk schema change; no version bump needed for the IDB schema. 28 new unit tests cover generic contract behavior, IDB single-transaction verification, and Redis MGET semantics including per-key error tolerance and deduplication.

## 5.30.0

### Patch Changes

- 9154ac7: feat(integration): Salesforce + Sage Intacct pipeline hardening

  **This is in-progress work — not ready to merge.** PR is open for incremental review and discussion.

  ### Sage Intacct connector
  - Range-chunked walk over `RECORDNO` for numeric-PK objects, replacing the previous PK-cursor strategy that silently dropped records when SI's natural scan order wasn't PK-ascending.
  - Upper-bound discovery via exponential probe so termination is exact (not heuristic).
  - Sub-range verification on every completed chunk (independent count of two halves must sum to the parent's count) to catch SI inconsistencies that would otherwise silently undercount.
  - Discovery-probe retry with backoff for transport-only errors; immediate fail-stop on SI API errors (permissions, schema, syntax).
  - `WHENMODIFIED` filter values normalized to SI's `MM/DD/YYYY HH:mm:ss` format — the engine sometimes passes ISO 8601 which SI rejects with `DL02000001`.
  - Bumped `DEFAULT_PAGE_SIZE` from 100 to 1000 (proven safe via probing); legacy single-pull path now hard-fails on full-page-no-resultId instead of silently dropping records via PK-cursor.

  ### Salesforce connector
  - Removed dead `queryLocator` member field. `if (this.queryLocator && ctx.CurrentCursor)` was always false (member never assigned), so every "next batch" call re-executed the original SOQL and returned the same first page until the engine's duplicate-batch guard aborted the entity. Continuation now uses `ctx.CurrentCursor` directly via `FetchNextPage`.
  - Per-batch dedup by `Id` for system metadata sObjects (TabDefinition, FormulaFunctionAllowedType) where SF returns multiple records sharing the placeholder Id `000000000000000AAA`. Drops are logged once per object instead of producing N per-record `UQ_<table>_PK` constraint violations.
  - Removed the over-aggressive `!obj.createable` filter on `isUserRelevantSObject`. Many SF objects are flagged non-createable but carry real customer data (rollups, attachment-link junctions, history-style records).
  - `BuildSOQLQuery` no longer emits `LIMIT batchSize` — that was silently capping every full result set at the page size. Pagination is via SF's native `done` / `nextRecordsUrl`.
  - Watermark comparison uses `>=` instead of `>` so records modified at exactly the watermark instant aren't dropped on the next sync.

  ### IntegrationEngine
  - New typed `SchemaNotGeneratedError` (and `detectSchemaNotGenerated` helper) — `CreateRecord`/`UpdateRecord` now detect the SQL Server `Could not find stored procedure` pattern, throw the typed error, and `ProcessPullSync` fail-stops the entire EntityMap with one `[CONFIGURATION_ERROR]` log line + remaining records marked skipped. Previously every record produced an identical per-record error, drowning sync reports in O(records) duplicates.

  ### Picker → ApplyAll resolver fixes (`IntegrationDiscoveryResolver`)
  - New `resolveSourceObjectsToNames` per-item ID/Name fallback resolver. The old `resolveSourceObjectNames` only honored the IDs path and silently discarded any selection that arrived with `SourceObjectName` only (typical for newly-discovered objects with no IntegrationObject row yet). Real-world impact: 1,156 picker selections were collapsing to 420 IntegrationObjects to 181 generated tables. `LogError` now fires on truly unresolvable selections.
  - `buildTargetConfigs` collects every silent skip into three buckets (`notInSchema`, `noFields`, `noPK`) and emits a single summary line per call: `[buildTargetConfigs summary] requested=X, accepted=Y, dropped=Z (...)`. Lossy stages in the pipeline are now greppable.

  ### SchemaEngine RSU pipeline
  - `executeMigration` chunks oversized migration SQL (>32KB) into batches of 25 statements per `ExecuteSQL` call. Salesforce-class schemas (1100+ tables) produce migrations with 17K+ ALTER TABLE statements as a single batch, which exceeded mssql's client request timeout (30s). Each chunk now resets the timeout clock.

  ### Other
  - `IntegrationSchemaSync` and `IntegrationApplyAllBatch` plumbing for filtered IntrospectSchema flow (Salesforce-only path that describes selected objects rather than a full-org probe).
  - Integration dashboard UI tweaks (connections page rendering for high-FK supertype entities).

- b1f32a4: Tighten the fast-startup window so all parallel engine loads share the local cache, defer background metadata validation until after StartupManager finishes, parallelize per-param IndexedDB cache checks, gzip-compress AllMetadata in localStorage, scope UserInfoEngine loads by UserID on the Network provider, and replace GeoDataEngine's Web Worker boundary parser with synchronous parsing to avoid an 11+s structured-clone stall.

### Minor Changes

- c91269e: migration file for permissions driving minor bump

### Patch Changes

- 8ee0d86: Fix: Query parameter validation and cascade delete transaction handling
  - Added validation to ensure query parameters are JSON objects rather than arrays in GraphQL system user client
  - Implemented automatic transaction wrapping for entities with CascadeDeletes enabled
  - For database providers (server-side), delete operations are wrapped in
    BeginTransaction/CommitTransaction/RollbackTransaction
  - For network providers (client-side), deletes pass through as cascade handling occurs server-side
  - Ensures atomicity of cascade delete operations

## 2.76.0

### Patch Changes

- f1e5990: bug fix
- 087595d: feat: make DeleteQuery options parameter optional and refactor
  GraphQLSystemUserClient methods
  - Made options parameter optional in DeleteQuerySystemResolver with
    sensible defaults (SkipEntityAIActions: false, SkipEntityActions: false)
  - Refactored GraphQLSystemUserClient method names for better usability by
    removing redundant "SystemUser" suffix
  - Updated method signatures to use proper input types instead of
    individual parameters for better type safety
  - Added DeleteQuery method and missing TypeScript interfaces to
    GraphQLSystemUserClient

  The changes are marked as minor since they add new functionality
  (optional parameters, new method) while maintaining backward
  compatibility with existing method signatures.

## 2.75.0

### Minor Changes

- 66640d6: This update brings the GraphQLSystemUserClient to feature parity with the
  standard GraphQLDataProvider by adding full Parameters support for
  templated queries, pagination capabilities, and the missing
  GetQueryDataByNameSystemUser resolver.

  Key Features:
  - Parameters support for templated queries (enabling AI cost calculations)
  - MaxRows and StartRow pagination support
  - Complete resolver coverage for system user operations
  - Fixed TypeScript compilation errors with missing TotalRowCount fields
  - Updated both GetQueryDataSystemUser and GetQueryDataByNameSystemUser
    methods with full parameter support
    - Added missing GetQueryDataByNameSystemUser resolver with proper
      @RequireSystemUser decoration
    - Fixed error handling cases to include required TotalRowCount field
    - Updated GraphQL query strings to include TotalRowCount and
      AppliedParameters fields

    This enables system user clients to leverage MemberJunction v2.74's
    templated query functionality, particularly important for AI cost tracking
    and other parameterized operations.

- 6a65fad: feat: Add AI Agent Run cost calculation with high-performance templated
  queries
  - Add AIAgentRunCostService with intelligent caching and single-query
    performance optimization
  - Implement CalculateAIAgentRunCost templated query using recursive CTE for
    hierarchical cost calculation
  - Fix GraphQL scalar type error (JSON → JSONObject) in RunQuery operations
  - Update AI Agent Run components to display consistent cost metrics in both
    top banner and analytics tab
  - Fix analytics component data loading to use proper entity relationships
    via AI Agent Run Steps
  - Add comprehensive metadata structure for AI queries with
    cross-environment schema compatibility
  - Remove debugging console statements for clean production output

  This enhancement provides accurate, performant cost tracking for AI Agent
  Runs including all nested sub-agent hierarchies up to 20 levels deep,
  replacing inefficient multiple database calls with a single optimized
  query.
