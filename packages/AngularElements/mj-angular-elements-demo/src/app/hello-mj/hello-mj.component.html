<!-- 
  Hello MJ Component Template
  
  This template displays:
  1. A heading showing the count of entities (only shown when entities are loaded)
  2. A button to trigger the loading and display of entity information
  
  When the Display button is clicked, it calls the showInfo() method
  which loads the entities and emits events with the entity data.
-->
<div>
    <!-- Only show the heading when entities have been loaded -->
    <h1 *ngIf="entityCount > 0">{{entityCount}} Entities Loaded</h1>
    
    <!-- Button to trigger loading and displaying entity information -->
    <button (click)="showInfo()">Display</button>
</div>
