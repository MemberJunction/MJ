 * This is the base class for executing filters to determine if an action should be run. The CodeGen tool generates sub-classes of this class for each Action Filter in the system. The code injected into the
 * auto-generated sub-classes will implement the InternalRunFilter method which is called by this base class. If you would like to use code generation for your Action Filter, but modify the logic for executing
 * the filter you can sub-class the auto-generated sub-class. For this second level sub-class, you should use the @RegisterClass decorator from the @memberjunction/global package to register your subclass with 
 * the ClassFactory so that it will be used instead of the auto generated sub-class. This is the same pattern as how you would insert custom logic into a custom sub-class of BaseEntity.
