 * Why a save must not write `Task.SecurityEnvelope`, or null when it may.
 *
 * The envelope holds the constraints of the agent run that submitted a task graph — its bound
 * parameters, audience, tenant scope and taint — and the dispatcher enforces it on every node. It is
 * written once, when the row is created (the server's own graph submission and its compensation
 * tasks), and never changed: a later edit could only loosen what the submitting run was held to, so
 * any change to it on an existing row is refused, whoever makes it.
