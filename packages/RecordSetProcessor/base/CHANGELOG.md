### Minor Changes

- bda123a: Lists performance overhaul + bug fixes. Read path: the custom List form paginates its Items section (100/page) and resolves member display names in one batched `IN` query per page instead of one query per item (a 1,000-member list drops from ~1,000 requests to 3); the Lists Browse/My Lists dashboards and the Add-to-List panel compute per-list counts via batched count_only queries instead of downloading every List Detail row; single-list-detail export filters membership server-side via a vwListDetails subquery instead of a client-built giant IN clause. Write path: client-side removals batch through TransactionGroups; server-side ListOperations bulk insert/remove and the "Add Records to List" action run with bounded concurrency (10 in-flight) while preserving per-record error isolation. ListSource switches to keyset (AfterKey) pagination with legacy Offset-cursor resume support. DB migration dedupes ListDetail in-place (keeping the oldest row per pair), adds a UNIQUE composite (ListID, RecordID) index that covers the duplicate-check predicate and closes the concurrent-add race, and drops the redundant single-column ListID index. Bug fixes: Add Records dialog spinner never cleared without a user click (missing change-detection after async loads, fixed in both the List form and single-list-detail); the List form's open-record button did nothing; silently-skipped duplicate adds now surface in a result toast (new optional `summary` on `ListManagementResult`). Also: Browse favorites filter persists as a server-side user preference; entities without a NameField now display and search on a sensible fallback field (`ID — value`, new `GetRecordDisplayField` helper); set-operation membership loads and operand pickers carry defensive MaxRows caps with truncation flagging.

### Minor Changes

- 0fa3cbc: Record Set Processing & Record Processes, plus the Remote Operations primitive.

  **Remote Operations** (`@memberjunction/core`, `@memberjunction/global`, `@memberjunction/graphql-dataprovider`, `@memberjunction/server`) — a typed, provider-routed capability the browser and server both invoke through one call site, the peer of `BaseEntity` (CRUD) and `RunView` (set reads):
  - `BaseRemotableOperation<TInput,TOutput>` with `OperationKey` / `RequiredScope` / `RequiresSystemUser` / `ExecutionMode`; `Execute()` routes per-provider, `ExecuteServer()` runs in-process and never throws on logical failure.
  - `IRemoteOperationProvider.RouteOperation` on `ProviderBase` (the documented power tool), in-process dispatch in `DatabaseProviderBase`, GraphQL marshalling in `GraphQLDataProvider`, and the single generic `ExecuteRemoteOperation` resolver that composes the existing API-key-scope + user-permission auth chain.
  - Genericized value-mapping resolver in `@memberjunction/global` (`getValueAtPath` / `resolveMappingRef` / `resolveValueMapping`) — one canonical mapping engine over pluggable named sources.

  **Record Set Processing substrate** (`@memberjunction/record-set-processor-base`, `@memberjunction/record-set-processor`) — a hardened iterate-a-record-set-and-do-work engine with three pluggable seams (source / processor / run-tracker): batching, bounded concurrency, rate limiting, circuit breaker, checkpoint/resume, and pause/cancel. Ships Array/View/List/Filter/Keyset sources; Action / Agent / Infer record processors; a uniform `WriteBackProcessor` that applies an `OutputMapping` (fields / child record) to any work type; the `RecordProcessExecutor` facade (Scope→source, Work→processor); and the `RecordProcess.RunNow` / `GetRunStatus` / `Pause` / `Resume` / `Cancel` control operations.

  **Record Processes facade** (`@memberjunction/core-entities`, `@memberjunction/core-entities-server`, `@memberjunction/scheduling-engine`, `@memberjunction/actions`) — the `MJ: Record Processes` definition (Work × Scope × Trigger) plus generic `MJ: Process Runs` / `Process Run Details` tracking and the `MJ: Remote Operations` registry. `MJRecordProcessEntityServer` reconciles the owned recurrence Scheduled Job on save; `RecordProcessScheduledJobDriver` runs a process on its cron schedule and links each `ProcessRun` back to its `ScheduledJobRun`; the Entity Action `GetRecordList` View/List fan-out backs scoped iteration.
