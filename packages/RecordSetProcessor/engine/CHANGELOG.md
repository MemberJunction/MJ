# @memberjunction/record-set-processor

## 6.2.0-edge.2

### Minor Changes

- 4248fb3: Add `DecisionFeaturePipelineDriver`, an infer processor driver that evaluates structured decisions through `AIDecisionRunner` for feature pipelines. Supports Likelihood (boolean with configurable constraint threshold), Choice (enum), and Score (numeric with 2-10 level rubrics) outputs, confidence tracking, and metadata catalog integration.
- ef43cf3: Add `MJ: Feature Pipeline Types`, the catalog of Knowledge Hub Feature Pipeline types. Each type names the driver class that turns a record's context into its output values, so a new type is a row plus a registered class. Seeds the `LLM` type, which is what every existing pipeline is.

### Patch Changes

- 664baea: A Decision Feature Pipeline can now escalate its borderline records to an LLM Feature Pipeline: set `Escalation` (the LLM pipeline's ID and a confidence floor) in its spec, and only the records whose confidence falls below the floor are re-run through the LLM pipeline, whose answers replace the decision's.
- 513e608: Add pipeline type picker, capability-aware output filtering and validation, Decision-specific constraint editors, and type badges for Feature Pipelines. What each pipeline type can produce is now one rule set, shared by the server, the builder and the save check. A Decision pipeline reads enum values and descriptions from its own entity's fields only; before, it read them from any entity with a field of the same name. An enum reads field metadata only when it sets FromFieldMetadata or lists no values, and only a type that needs listed values (Decision) requires them.

  A Record Process now refuses at save an Infer pipeline its type cannot run, on both tiers and every save path, through the shared MJRecordProcessEntityExtended; the Record Process form also refuses while the builder reports errors. The builder loads and edits CaptureReasoning, and keeps Watermark. Its pickers now show the saved pipeline type, prompt, entity document, target and constraint, not the first option, and a placeholder when the saved value is not offered.

- 9096523: Infer's output check now resolves an enum's allowed values from field metadata (`FromFieldMetadata`), so those outputs are no longer failed, nulled or coerced to 'Other' on every record. A confidence is no longer recorded for an output whose value a `null` or `coerce-to-other` policy replaced.
- e9ab27b: feat(record-processes): add borderline escalation section to feature pipeline builder and extract escalation target problem validators to feature-pipelines

## 6.2.0-edge.1

### Patch Changes

- 80905a1: Rename public class members and exported functions to PascalCase, per MJ's naming convention,
  **without breaking a single consumer**.

  Every renamed symbol keeps its old name beside the new one as a `@deprecated` stub that forwards to
  it — a delegating method or function, a getter/setter pair for a property, and for Angular a
  readable accessor pair for an `@Input` and a second `@Output` sharing the same `EventEmitter`, so a
  template still binding the old name keeps receiving events. Old names still compile, still resolve,
  and still behave identically; the deprecation tag rides through to the published `.d.ts`, so editors
  point callers at the replacement. Where a package re-exports through an explicit `export { … }`
  list, the new name is added alongside the old, so the correct name is actually on the public surface
  rather than merely declared.

  The rename is deliberately refused wherever a mechanical stub would not be equivalent, because
  several of those shapes change a type contract while still compiling in the package that declares
  them:
  - an **optional** property or parameter property — TypeScript has no optional accessor, so a stub
    would promote `foo?` to a required member and break every object literal that omits it;
  - a class that is a **data shape** (no methods, or `@ObjectType`/`@InputType`) — object literals are
    assigned to it, and an accessor stub changes what they must supply;
  - a property whose **subclass redeclares it**, since TypeScript forbids a property overriding an
    accessor (TS2610);
  - a name whose PascalCase form is **already bound** in that file or class;
  - decorated members, `get`/`set` pairs behind a decorator, generators, destructured parameters,
    overload sets and abstract members.

  **One wire-visible consequence, for version skew only.** `BaseInfo.toJSON` walks `_`-prefixed
  backing fields and emits them through their public getter, preferring the PascalCase one. Renaming
  the 23 field aliases in `MJCore/src/generic` therefore changes what `AllMetadata` carries:
  `EntityInfo.spCreate` and friends now serialize as `SpCreate`. A same-version client is unaffected —
  `copyInitData` accepts a value through a settable accessor, so either spelling lands on the right
  field. An OLDER client against a newer server has no such path in its `copyInitData` and drops those
  fields silently. Same-version deployments, which is the supported configuration, see no change.

  Each package was verified against its own pre-change baseline rather than against zero, because
  several packages in this repo do not typecheck cleanly to begin with. Angular packages were verified
  with `ngc`, not `tsc`: a plain typecheck does not compile templates, and an earlier write-only
  `@Input` alias passed `tsc` while breaking six template reads.

## 6.1.0

### Patch Changes

- 92f2ac9: Repo-wide sweep of code that assumed an entity's primary key is a single column named `ID`, plus a `PrimaryKeyCompliance` gate in `@memberjunction/core` so the pattern cannot come back.

  MJ supports primary keys with any column name(s) and type(s). Every MJ core entity happens to use `ID`, so hardcoding it works across the whole core product and silently breaks on customer entities mapped from external schemas — `Load()` rejects the invented field name, or a composite key is truncated to its first column. #4179 (search result click-through) was one instance; this sweep found the same shape in ~90 files and fixes all of it on top of the `CompositeKey.FromURLSegment` / `FromEntityRecord` / `ToCompactURLSegment` primitives introduced with that fix.

  **What changed, by kind**
  - **Literal `ID` key construction** (`{ FieldName: 'ID', Value: x }`, `LoadFromSingleKeyValuePair('ID', …)`, `FromKeyValuePair('ID', …)`) — ~135 sites. Where the entity is a literal MJ core entity the key is now `CompositeKey.FromID(x)`, the one sanctioned way to say "this entity's key is `ID`". Where the entity is a variable (an event's `EntityName`, an `entityInfo`, a configured entity) the key is `CompositeKey.FromURLSegment(entityInfo, recordId)`, which reads a bare value or a `F1|v1||F2|v2` segment against the entity's real primary key(s).
  - **`PrimaryKeys[0]` → `FirstPrimaryKey`** — 39 sites. Same semantics, a named accessor the gate can track. IS-A shared-key and keyset uses are annotated `// first-pk-ok`.
  - **Real defects fixed** (arbitrary entity keyed as `ID`): Mobile app record load/edit/offline sync; the generic form overlay; the ERD "open record" path; version-history label/diff/micro-view links (which stripped `ID|` off a stored key and re-wrapped the value as `ID`); `RestoreEngine` and `buildPrimaryKeyForLoad`; the Apollo enrichment connector (six `GetEntityObject(configuredEntity, FromID(record.ID))` calls); geocoding record reload; List Detail record-open (composite keys now open instead of showing a notice); `EmbeddedRecord`; `DatabaseReferenceScanner`; hardcoded `ID` filters on a variable entity in Data Explorer's record load, Predictive Studio's label lookup, the realtime-widget visitor identity lookup, `DuplicateRecordDetector.LoadRecordsByListID`, and MetadataSync's `@lookup` GUID conversion.
  - **REST API**: `EntityCRUDHandler` / `RESTEndpointHandler` built the key from the `:id` segment for single-column keys only and threw "Composite primary keys are not supported". Both now accept a bare value or a URL-encoded `Field1|Value1||Field2|Value2` segment. Single-column behavior is unchanged.
  - **One serializer instead of eight**: `ListOperations.serializeRecordId`, `list-set-operations.serializeRecordId`, RecordSetProcessor's `serializeRecordId`, `GetListRecordsAction`'s inline copy, `MJListDetailEntityExtended.BuildRecordID` / `GetCompositeKey`, `record.util.buildCompositeKey`, `VersionHistory.buildCompositeKeyFromRecord` and `ChangeDetector.buildDeleteItem` all delegate to `CompositeKey.FromEntityRecord(...).ToCompactURLSegment()` / `FromURLSegment(...)`. Output is byte-identical for single-column keys.

  **`FirstPrimaryKey` triage** — every one of the ~390 `FirstPrimaryKey` / `FromID` uses in the repo was read in context and either rewritten or annotated with a reason (154 annotations). Real defects found and fixed along the way, all of the shape "first key column used as the whole key" on an entity that can be composite-keyed:
  - **Data providers**: the deterministic `ORDER BY` fallback for row-limited queries ordered by the first key column only, leaving composite-key pages in undefined order; it now orders by every key column. Saved-view run logging / exclusion and the `{%UserView%}` template subquery, whose persisted `RecordID` cannot hold a composite key, now refuse loudly instead of excluding wrong rows. The dependency-link subquery now predicates on the full key. Single-column SQL is byte-identical.
  - **CodeGen**: generated cascade delete/update procs bound the child FK to `@<firstPK>` regardless of which parent key column the FK references; a composite key containing an identity column dropped the other key columns from the generated INSERT (both providers); the PostgreSQL JSON-arg `spCreate` inserted only the first key column; the generated join-grid/timeline filters and the GraphQL audit-log `RecordID` truncated composite keys. Single-key generator output verified byte-identical against `HEAD` (168 shapes).
  - **Smart cache** (`ProviderBase` differential merge): keyed rows on the first PK, so composite-key deletes never applied and rows sharing the first column collapsed.
  - **Integration push sync**: composed record identity from the first key column while the record map stores all columns joined, so every already-synced composite-key row was re-created externally as a duplicate on each full push; the changed-record path silently dropped rows.
  - **Scheduled geocoding orphan cleanup** (destructive): compared a cast of the first key column to a `RecordID` holding all columns, so every geocode row for a composite-key entity was deleted on each run.
  - **Lists**: list membership, export and add-record paths filtered on the first key column and wrote only its value into `ListDetail.RecordID`; Explorer "open record" paths on user-selected entities, duplicate detection, omnibar record search, Data Explorer deep links, the sharing center revoke, recent-access, tree dropdowns, the mobile app's record ids and offline queue.
  - **AI**: duplicate detection, vector sync record ids, Predictive Studio list scope and write-back; the Recommendations engine also wrote a record id into `SourceEntityID` (an FK to Entities) and never set `SourceEntityRecordID`.
  - **Apollo enrichment**: `Accounts` (a customer entity) loaded by literal `ID`; the contacts path read its key off an entity that had never been loaded.
  - Every `entityInfo.FirstPrimaryKey?.Name ?? 'ID'` fallback is gone; where the entity can be missing the code now fails loudly instead of inventing `ID`.

  **The gate** — `packages/MJCore/src/__tests__/PrimaryKeyCompliance.test.ts`, modelled on `MultiProviderCompliance` / `UUIDCompliance`:
  1. _Strict_: a key built with a literal `ID` field name. Marker `// pk-literal-ok: <reason>`.
  2. _Strict_: `PrimaryKeys[0]` / `PrimaryKeys.at(0)`.
  3. _Strict_: `FirstPrimaryKey` and `CompositeKey.FromID(`. These are legitimate only where MJ is single-column by design (foreign-key targets, keyset `ORDER BY` / `AfterKey`, IS-A shared keys, core entities), so every use must be self-evidently on a core entity or say why: `FromID` is exempt when a `'MJ: …'` entity literal is on the same line or within 8 lines above (the `GetEntityObject` / `OpenEntityRecord` naming the core entity); everything else carries `// first-pk-ok: <reason>` on the same line, reason mandatory.
  4. _Strict_: an `ID = …` / `ID IN (…)` `ExtraFilter` or `Fields: ['ID']` within eight lines of an `EntityName:` that is a variable rather than a string literal or ALL_CAPS constant. Marker `// pk-filter-ok: <reason>`.

  Generated code, tests, `dist/`, and the `TestingFramework` / `UnitTesting` packages are not scanned. The rule is written up in `.claude/rules/data-access.md` § "Primary keys: never assume a column named ID". There is no baseline file: all four gates are strict.

  No public signatures change; every edit is additive or a same-shape substitution, so this is `patch` throughout.

## 6.1.0-edge.6

### Patch Changes

- 92f2ac9: Repo-wide sweep of code that assumed an entity's primary key is a single column named `ID`, plus a `PrimaryKeyCompliance` gate in `@memberjunction/core` so the pattern cannot come back.

  MJ supports primary keys with any column name(s) and type(s). Every MJ core entity happens to use `ID`, so hardcoding it works across the whole core product and silently breaks on customer entities mapped from external schemas — `Load()` rejects the invented field name, or a composite key is truncated to its first column. #4179 (search result click-through) was one instance; this sweep found the same shape in ~90 files and fixes all of it on top of the `CompositeKey.FromURLSegment` / `FromEntityRecord` / `ToCompactURLSegment` primitives introduced with that fix.

  **What changed, by kind**
  - **Literal `ID` key construction** (`{ FieldName: 'ID', Value: x }`, `LoadFromSingleKeyValuePair('ID', …)`, `FromKeyValuePair('ID', …)`) — ~135 sites. Where the entity is a literal MJ core entity the key is now `CompositeKey.FromID(x)`, the one sanctioned way to say "this entity's key is `ID`". Where the entity is a variable (an event's `EntityName`, an `entityInfo`, a configured entity) the key is `CompositeKey.FromURLSegment(entityInfo, recordId)`, which reads a bare value or a `F1|v1||F2|v2` segment against the entity's real primary key(s).
  - **`PrimaryKeys[0]` → `FirstPrimaryKey`** — 39 sites. Same semantics, a named accessor the gate can track. IS-A shared-key and keyset uses are annotated `// first-pk-ok`.
  - **Real defects fixed** (arbitrary entity keyed as `ID`): Mobile app record load/edit/offline sync; the generic form overlay; the ERD "open record" path; version-history label/diff/micro-view links (which stripped `ID|` off a stored key and re-wrapped the value as `ID`); `RestoreEngine` and `buildPrimaryKeyForLoad`; the Apollo enrichment connector (six `GetEntityObject(configuredEntity, FromID(record.ID))` calls); geocoding record reload; List Detail record-open (composite keys now open instead of showing a notice); `EmbeddedRecord`; `DatabaseReferenceScanner`; hardcoded `ID` filters on a variable entity in Data Explorer's record load, Predictive Studio's label lookup, the realtime-widget visitor identity lookup, `DuplicateRecordDetector.LoadRecordsByListID`, and MetadataSync's `@lookup` GUID conversion.
  - **REST API**: `EntityCRUDHandler` / `RESTEndpointHandler` built the key from the `:id` segment for single-column keys only and threw "Composite primary keys are not supported". Both now accept a bare value or a URL-encoded `Field1|Value1||Field2|Value2` segment. Single-column behavior is unchanged.
  - **One serializer instead of eight**: `ListOperations.serializeRecordId`, `list-set-operations.serializeRecordId`, RecordSetProcessor's `serializeRecordId`, `GetListRecordsAction`'s inline copy, `MJListDetailEntityExtended.BuildRecordID` / `GetCompositeKey`, `record.util.buildCompositeKey`, `VersionHistory.buildCompositeKeyFromRecord` and `ChangeDetector.buildDeleteItem` all delegate to `CompositeKey.FromEntityRecord(...).ToCompactURLSegment()` / `FromURLSegment(...)`. Output is byte-identical for single-column keys.

  **`FirstPrimaryKey` triage** — every one of the ~390 `FirstPrimaryKey` / `FromID` uses in the repo was read in context and either rewritten or annotated with a reason (154 annotations). Real defects found and fixed along the way, all of the shape "first key column used as the whole key" on an entity that can be composite-keyed:
  - **Data providers**: the deterministic `ORDER BY` fallback for row-limited queries ordered by the first key column only, leaving composite-key pages in undefined order; it now orders by every key column. Saved-view run logging / exclusion and the `{%UserView%}` template subquery, whose persisted `RecordID` cannot hold a composite key, now refuse loudly instead of excluding wrong rows. The dependency-link subquery now predicates on the full key. Single-column SQL is byte-identical.
  - **CodeGen**: generated cascade delete/update procs bound the child FK to `@<firstPK>` regardless of which parent key column the FK references; a composite key containing an identity column dropped the other key columns from the generated INSERT (both providers); the PostgreSQL JSON-arg `spCreate` inserted only the first key column; the generated join-grid/timeline filters and the GraphQL audit-log `RecordID` truncated composite keys. Single-key generator output verified byte-identical against `HEAD` (168 shapes).
  - **Smart cache** (`ProviderBase` differential merge): keyed rows on the first PK, so composite-key deletes never applied and rows sharing the first column collapsed.
  - **Integration push sync**: composed record identity from the first key column while the record map stores all columns joined, so every already-synced composite-key row was re-created externally as a duplicate on each full push; the changed-record path silently dropped rows.
  - **Scheduled geocoding orphan cleanup** (destructive): compared a cast of the first key column to a `RecordID` holding all columns, so every geocode row for a composite-key entity was deleted on each run.
  - **Lists**: list membership, export and add-record paths filtered on the first key column and wrote only its value into `ListDetail.RecordID`; Explorer "open record" paths on user-selected entities, duplicate detection, omnibar record search, Data Explorer deep links, the sharing center revoke, recent-access, tree dropdowns, the mobile app's record ids and offline queue.
  - **AI**: duplicate detection, vector sync record ids, Predictive Studio list scope and write-back; the Recommendations engine also wrote a record id into `SourceEntityID` (an FK to Entities) and never set `SourceEntityRecordID`.
  - **Apollo enrichment**: `Accounts` (a customer entity) loaded by literal `ID`; the contacts path read its key off an entity that had never been loaded.
  - Every `entityInfo.FirstPrimaryKey?.Name ?? 'ID'` fallback is gone; where the entity can be missing the code now fails loudly instead of inventing `ID`.

  **The gate** — `packages/MJCore/src/__tests__/PrimaryKeyCompliance.test.ts`, modelled on `MultiProviderCompliance` / `UUIDCompliance`:
  1. _Strict_: a key built with a literal `ID` field name. Marker `// pk-literal-ok: <reason>`.
  2. _Strict_: `PrimaryKeys[0]` / `PrimaryKeys.at(0)`.
  3. _Strict_: `FirstPrimaryKey` and `CompositeKey.FromID(`. These are legitimate only where MJ is single-column by design (foreign-key targets, keyset `ORDER BY` / `AfterKey`, IS-A shared keys, core entities), so every use must be self-evidently on a core entity or say why: `FromID` is exempt when a `'MJ: …'` entity literal is on the same line or within 8 lines above (the `GetEntityObject` / `OpenEntityRecord` naming the core entity); everything else carries `// first-pk-ok: <reason>` on the same line, reason mandatory.
  4. _Strict_: an `ID = …` / `ID IN (…)` `ExtraFilter` or `Fields: ['ID']` within eight lines of an `EntityName:` that is a variable rather than a string literal or ALL_CAPS constant. Marker `// pk-filter-ok: <reason>`.

  Generated code, tests, `dist/`, and the `TestingFramework` / `UnitTesting` packages are not scanned. The rule is written up in `.claude/rules/data-access.md` § "Primary keys: never assume a column named ID". There is no baseline file: all four gates are strict.

  No public signatures change; every edit is additive or a same-shape substitution, so this is `patch` throughout.

## 5.43.0

### Minor Changes

- 9f6aa87: Generic fire-and-forget save queue, realtime multi-agent floor control, and telemetry fixes.

  **Generic fire-and-forget save queue** (`@memberjunction/global`, `@memberjunction/core`, + adopters) — de-duplicates the hand-rolled "INSERT (fire-and-forget) → chained UPDATE" persistence pattern and makes the "stuck at Running" race structurally impossible:
  - `KeyedSerialTaskQueue` (`@memberjunction/global`) — entity-agnostic per-key serial task chain: same-key tasks serialize, different keys run concurrently, failures are tallied for `flush()` and never propagate. Self-bounding (in-flight set + failure counters), so a long-lived queue that never flushes doesn't grow.
  - `BaseEntitySaveQueue` (`@memberjunction/core`) — entity façade: `Insert` / `Update(entity, applyMutation?)` / `Flush`, with an optional `onError` hook for structured logging. `Update`'s mutation runs _inside_ the post-INSERT task, so it can never be reverted by the INSERT's reload.
  - Adopted in all three hand-rolled copies + the new consumer: `GenericProcessRunTracker` (`@memberjunction/record-set-processor`), `AgentRunStepSaveQueue` (`@memberjunction/ai-core-plus`), `ActionEngine`'s execution log (`@memberjunction/actions`), and `AIPromptRunner` / `AIModelRunner` (`@memberjunction/ai-prompts`). Also fixes a pre-existing `MJLruCache` mock gap in the Actions/Engine test suite.

  **Realtime** (`@memberjunction/ai`, `@memberjunction/ai-bridge-server`, `@memberjunction/ai-gemini`, `@memberjunction/ai-openai`, `@memberjunction/livekit-room-server`, `@memberjunction/ng-livekit-room`) — multi-agent floor control, Gemini meeting mode, the session capability surface with first-agent re-gating, and an idle reaper.

  **Telemetry / core** (`@memberjunction/core`, `@memberjunction/server`) — cacheability-aware duplicate-RunView suggestion for `AllowCaching=false` entities; fixes the telemetry pagination-fingerprint false-duplicate and batches the janitor channel reads.

## 5.42.0

### Minor Changes

- 0fa3cbc: Record Set Processing & Record Processes, plus the Remote Operations primitive.

  **Remote Operations** (`@memberjunction/core`, `@memberjunction/global`, `@memberjunction/graphql-dataprovider`, `@memberjunction/server`) — a typed, provider-routed capability the browser and server both invoke through one call site, the peer of `BaseEntity` (CRUD) and `RunView` (set reads):
  - `BaseRemotableOperation<TInput,TOutput>` with `OperationKey` / `RequiredScope` / `RequiresSystemUser` / `ExecutionMode`; `Execute()` routes per-provider, `ExecuteServer()` runs in-process and never throws on logical failure.
  - `IRemoteOperationProvider.RouteOperation` on `ProviderBase` (the documented power tool), in-process dispatch in `DatabaseProviderBase`, GraphQL marshalling in `GraphQLDataProvider`, and the single generic `ExecuteRemoteOperation` resolver that composes the existing API-key-scope + user-permission auth chain.
  - Genericized value-mapping resolver in `@memberjunction/global` (`getValueAtPath` / `resolveMappingRef` / `resolveValueMapping`) — one canonical mapping engine over pluggable named sources.

  **Record Set Processing substrate** (`@memberjunction/record-set-processor-base`, `@memberjunction/record-set-processor`) — a hardened iterate-a-record-set-and-do-work engine with three pluggable seams (source / processor / run-tracker): batching, bounded concurrency, rate limiting, circuit breaker, checkpoint/resume, and pause/cancel. Ships Array/View/List/Filter/Keyset sources; Action / Agent / Infer record processors; a uniform `WriteBackProcessor` that applies an `OutputMapping` (fields / child record) to any work type; the `RecordProcessExecutor` facade (Scope→source, Work→processor); and the `RecordProcess.RunNow` / `GetRunStatus` / `Pause` / `Resume` / `Cancel` control operations.

  **Record Processes facade** (`@memberjunction/core-entities`, `@memberjunction/core-entities-server`, `@memberjunction/scheduling-engine`, `@memberjunction/actions`) — the `MJ: Record Processes` definition (Work × Scope × Trigger) plus generic `MJ: Process Runs` / `Process Run Details` tracking and the `MJ: Remote Operations` registry. `MJRecordProcessEntityServer` reconciles the owned recurrence Scheduled Job on save; `RecordProcessScheduledJobDriver` runs a process on its cron schedule and links each `ProcessRun` back to its `ScheduledJobRun`; the Entity Action `GetRecordList` View/List fan-out backs scoped iteration.
