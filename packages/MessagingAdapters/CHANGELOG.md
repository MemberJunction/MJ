- 5f33ca8: Slack and Teams adapters: first production bring-up

  Defects found running the adapters against a real MJ app — one Slack app per agent
  (Socket Mode) plus Teams via Bot Framework.

  **Startup and identity**
  - Users are resolved via `UserCache.Instance`. `new UserCache()` returned the shared
    singleton and then re-initialized it empty, so no messaging extension could start
    and the whole server lost its user cache until the next refresh.
  - Running one platform app per agent no longer causes bots to cross-talk in shared
    channels: thread replies are answered only by the addressed bot, bot-authored
    messages are excluded from history and thread affinity, and a new
    `DisableDelegation` setting stops a pinned bot from handing off.
  - A bot recognises its own replies. Slack publishes two identifiers for one bot and
    returns the `bot_id` (with no `user`) for any message posted with a username
    override — which every agent reply uses, since per-agent identity is the point of
    one app per agent. Comparing only against `auth.test()`'s `user_id` therefore never
    matched, so the thread gate above declined threads the bot was actively holding and
    the agent lost its own turns from context.

  **Delivery**
  - Generated files and images are delivered as real attachments. Adapters may
    implement `uploadMediaOutputs` (Slack does, and needs the `files:write` scope);
    inlined `data:` URIs are decoded; and the run's canonical `fileOutputs` are used
    rather than depending on the model to inline them.
  - A non-public button URL no longer fails the entire Slack message — it degrades to
    a link, so a localhost `ExplorerBaseURL` stops suppressing replies outright.
  - The artifact link points at the file the agent produced rather than its internal
    payload, and `System Only` artifacts are no longer linked. Callers relying on
    `artifactInfo` being the payload artifact now receive the file artifact when a run
    produced one.
  - `ng-artifacts`: downloading a file artifact returns real bytes under its own MIME
    type and filename, instead of a `.txt` file full of base64.
  - `ng-explorer-core`: a conversation deep link opened cold now honours the URL rather
    than restoring the previously-viewed conversation.

  **Slack**
  - Interactivity works in Socket Mode; previously every button and modal was inert, so
    human-in-the-loop form flows dead-ended.
  - Message text is capped at the real `text` limit rather than the block-payload limit,
    which was failing long responses with `msg_too_long`.
  - Modal placeholders are truncated to 150 characters; an over-long one failed the whole
    `views.open` and left a button that looked dead.

  **Teams**
  - `MentionedAgentNames` is populated, so a named agent is reachable at all — previously
    every Teams turn ran the default agent.
  - Response forms route the answer back to the agent that asked, via `mj_agent`.
  - Buttons are built only over `http:`/`https:` URLs. Teams silently ignores `data:`/`blob:`/`file:`
    (so "Download document" was dead by construction whenever MJ inlined the artifact) and hands
    unknown schemes such as `javascript:` or `ms-msdt:` to the OS URI handler, so the check is an
    allow-list. Dropped buttons become a note pointing at the artifact link; localhost stays allowed.
  - A response form's submitted agent name is validated against the known agents before it is used
    to route, rather than trusted from the client-controlled submit payload.
  - Deep links no longer assume `resourceId` is present, now that a Record can be
    addressed by `keys`.

### Patch Changes

- d8adda1: **BREAKING — `UserCache` moved packages. Update the import, not just the call.**

  `UserCache` now lives in `@memberjunction/generic-database-provider`. It is no longer exported
  from `@memberjunction/sqlserver-dataprovider`, and there is deliberately **no re-export shim**,
  so every import of the symbol must be repointed or it will fail to resolve:

  ```diff
  - import { UserCache } from '@memberjunction/sqlserver-dataprovider';
  + import { UserCache } from '@memberjunction/generic-database-provider';
  ```

  `Refresh` is now dialect-neutral and takes the configured provider rather than an
  `mssql.ConnectionPool`:

  ```diff
  - await UserCache.Instance.Refresh(pool, intervalMs);
  + await UserCache.Instance.Refresh(provider, intervalMs);
  ```

  **These are two separate breaks, and the first is much wider than the second.** The import path
  affects _every_ consumer of the symbol — reads included. The signature affects only the handful
  of callers of `Refresh`. Anything that imports `UserCache` merely to call `Users`,
  `GetSystemUser()` or `UserByName()` still has to change its import, so a consumer who reads only
  "the signature changed" will treat this as a no-op and fail to build. In this repo the split was
  56 files versus 9 call sites.

  Packages that import `UserCache` must also declare `@memberjunction/generic-database-provider`
  as a dependency — pnpm resolves strictly, so an undeclared import fails rather than falling
  through to a hoisted copy.

  **Check for dynamic imports too**, not just static ones. `await import('@memberjunction/sqlserver-dataprovider')`
  destructuring `UserCache` breaks the same way, and a grep for `import { … } from` will not find it.

  **Unchanged:** the read surface (`Users`, `GetSystemUser`, `UserByName`, `SYSTEM_USER_ID`), and
  the class name. The name is load-bearing — `BaseSingleton` keys its global store on the
  constructor name, so keeping it `UserCache` preserves singleton identity across the move.

  **Also fixed:** `_users` now initializes to `[]`. It previously stayed `undefined` after a
  `Refresh` that never ran or that failed (failures are swallowed into `LogError`), so
  `GetSystemUser()` threw a `TypeError` off `.find()` instead of returning `undefined` as its
  callers already assume.

  **Why:** the cache was dialect-neutral except for that one `mssql` type, which left PostgreSQL
  with no user cache at all and produced four separate hand-rolled "read `vwUsers` + `vwUserRoles`,
  build `UserInfo[]`" implementations — one of which reached into the singleton's private field
  through a cast from another package. Those are all removed, and a PostgreSQL process that never
  goes through the server bootstrap now has a system user.

### Minor Changes

- 394d276: Phase 2 of the unified workflow DAG engine program (plan: PR #3456) — task-graph execution moves server-side and becomes invocation-agnostic.

  **New package `@memberjunction/task-graph`.** Deliberately not AI-prefixed (D11): an LLM, deterministic code, or a human UI can all construct and submit a DAG. It contains `TaskGraphSpec` (the one fully-qualified contract every producer authors against, D16), a pure validator, `TaskGraphService` (submission), `TaskClaimStore` (the CAS claim protocol), and `TaskGraphDispatcher` (durable execution). Graph _semantics_ stay in the Phase 1 pure algorithms in `ai-core-plus` — eligibility, failure propagation, parent rollup and stall detection are consumed unchanged, so the in-run and durable executors cannot drift apart.

  **Submission is split from execution (D2).** `TaskGraphService.Submit` validates, resolves agents, persists parent + children + edges, and returns. Nothing waits for the work. That is what makes every channel equal (D1).

  **BREAKING: `ExecuteTaskGraph` is removed (D12).** It awaited an entire multi-step workflow inside one long-lived GraphQL request, so a page reload lost the awaited promise, a server restart orphaned every in-flight task, and no channel but Explorer could reach the substrate. Replaced by `SubmitTaskGraph`, `CancelTaskGraph`, and `RetryTask`. Accepted deliberately in the open v6 window; its sole known caller — the Explorer conversation client — becomes an observer in this same change.

  **The durable dispatcher.** A compare-and-swap claim protocol over `ClaimedBy`/`ClaimExpiresAt` (the columns Phase 1 landed): claiming is a single guarded `UPDATE ... WHERE Status='Pending'` whose rowcount decides the winner, so two instances never run the same task without a distributed lock manager. Long tasks heartbeat to extend their claim; startup and periodic reconciliation return expired claims to `Pending`, which is what turns a crash from "work stranded forever" into "work resumes". Per D20 _every_ state transition is guarded on `ClaimedBy=@me`, not just the initial claim, because `MJ: Tasks` stays user-writable — a stale executor's completion write fails cleanly instead of double-completing. Human tasks are exempt from reclamation: a task parked on a person legitimately has no claim, and reclaiming it would reset an approval out from under the user.

  **Server-side detection at three seams.** Task graphs emitted in an agent's payload are now detected and submitted from the MJServer run path, `BaseMessagingAdapter` (ahead of the existing text-regex delegation, since a structured graph is unambiguous), and the Scheduling drivers. Previously only the Explorer client looked, so **Slack/Teams and scheduled routines silently dropped every graph an agent emitted** — the plan's core verified gap. The detection shim is explicitly temporary and dies in Phase 3 when `Tasks` becomes a typed `nextStep`.

  **Provider isolation.** The dispatcher mints a fresh provider per task via an injected `ProviderFactory`, so parallel tasks never share a transaction scope. MJServer supplies the implementation, keeping the dependency MJServer → task-graph and never the reverse.

  **Also:** 18 new unit tests for the validator; integration bundle grows with the three seam checks deferred from Phase 1 (cycle rejection, unknown-agent rejection, payload columns), now targeting `TaskGraphService`'s public API.

- 394d276: Phase 3 of the unified workflow DAG engine program (plan: PR #3456) — durable task graphs become a first-class agent primitive.

  **`'Tasks'` joins the Loop response union.** An opted-in agent emits `nextStep.type = 'Tasks'` with a `TaskGraphSpec` and the framework does the rest. The distinction from `subAgents[]` is durability, not parallelism: `subAgents[]` is ephemeral fan-out that blocks the run and dies with it, while a task graph becomes real Task rows a server-side dispatcher owns — visible in the Tasks UI, resumable after a restart, able to wait on a human.

  **The capability is gated, and the gate is enforced rather than advisory.** `enableTaskGraphs` defaults to **false**, unlike every other Loop prompt parameter. The others only shape the prompt — turning one off saves tokens and an agent that emits the feature anyway still works. This one governs whether an agent may create durable rows that outlive its run, execute on a dispatcher under the submitting user, and spawn further agent runs. So beyond omitting the type from the prompt, `LoopAgentType` _rejects_ a `'Tasks'` step from a disabled agent with a corrective that steers it back to Sub-Agent/Actions. The gate fails closed: an absent flag, an absent params bag, and the string `"true"` are all refusals.

  This matters more than it looks, because `HarnessAgentType extends LoopAgentType` and intentionally inherits `DetermineNextStep` — so the primitive reaches external agent harnesses (Claude Code / Codex / Pi running inside MJ) the moment it reaches Loop agents. That inheritance is the design working, but it moves the gate from a nice property of one class to the thing standing between a sandboxed external CLI and durable server-side work. It is therefore tested through the harness path, with the inheritance itself pinned so a later override cannot silently move those assertions onto a different code path.

  **`TaskGraphSpec` and its validator move to `@memberjunction/ai-core-plus`,** next to the pure graph algorithms they belong with. That is what lets the agent framework validate a graph without depending on the durable-execution package — which would otherwise drag the entity layer and the dispatcher into every context that merely runs an agent, including unit tests with no database. The Loop type validates against the identical contract the server re-validates at submission (D16), so a graph cannot pass one check and fail a different one later.

  **Single-node constant folding (D9), recorded rather than silent.** A one-node graph with no edges, an agent assignee and default continuation is rewritten into an ordinary in-run sub-agent call — don't spin up loop machinery for a loop of one. The `TaskGraph` run step is written either way, carrying the spec, a `folded` flag and the reason. Three consequences: run forensics show why a graph did or didn't reach the dispatcher; a user who edits a two-node graph down to one can read the durability change off the run record instead of inferring it; and Save as Workflow (D17) attaches to the recorded spec, so the single-node case — the shape most likely worth promoting — stays promotable. `durable: true` opts back into a Task row.

  **Submission crosses a registered seam.** `TaskGraphSubmitter` is declared in `ai-core-plus` and implemented in `@memberjunction/task-graph`, resolved through the ClassFactory. A host with no durable-execution package gets `null` and the agent reports an honest failure — what must never happen is a graph vanishing quietly while the model believes it scheduled work.

  **Continuation contract.** The parent Task row durably carries `continuation`, `reinvokeDepth` and the delivery marker, because the dispatcher instance that finishes a graph is routinely not the one that accepted it. Delivery marks _before_ it acts: the worst case becomes a missed notification visible in the task record rather than a notification repeated on every reconciliation sweep forever — which, for `reinvoke`, would be an unbounded agent-run loop. Chains are capped at 5 hops, bounded separately from task-nesting depth because they are different loops; at the cap the mode degrades to `message` so results still reach the user. `'reinvoke'` itself is not wired here — it would invert the dependency to task-graph → ai-agents — and lands in Phase 4 where the dispatcher already holds an execution engine.

  **Sage and the Workflow Planner stop payload-smuggling.** Both prompts move from `payloadChangeRequest.newElements.taskGraph` to the real `nextStep`, and the temporary server-side payload sniff introduced in Phase 2 is deleted along with its messaging and scheduling call sites — the primitive submits inside the run, so channel seams no longer need to look.

  **Launch opt-ins (D3):** Sage, Workflow Planner, Query Builder, and the Research Agent with its four sub-agents. Workflow Planner is not on the plan's opt-in list, but emitting task graphs is that agent's entire job, so leaving it gated would have broken it outright.

  **Coverage:** 43 new unit tests (18 Loop, 5 harness, 20 continuation-metadata) and a new integration check, TG8, asserting both directions the metadata gate can be wrong — an opt-in that was never pushed leaves an agent unable to delegate at all, and a Loop _type_ default left on would hand durable reach to every Loop agent in the install at once. IT71 runs 8/8.

### Patch Changes

- 8d0d45a: build: declare dependencies that npm's hoisting was silently supplying, as part of the monorepo's cutover to pnpm.

  Under npm, a package could import a module it never declared and still resolve it, because npm flattens everything into the workspace-root `node_modules`. pnpm's strict, isolated linking gives a package only what it declares — so each of these was a latent bug that happened to work. They are fixed here independently of the package manager; nothing about the published API changes.

  Added declarations: `@types/mssql` (codegen-lib, sqlserver-dataprovider, testing-cli, testing-integration, react-test-harness), `@types/pg` (codegen-lib), `@types/express` (messaging-adapters, server-extensions-core), `@types/fs-extra` (codegen-lib), `@types/babel__traverse` (react-linter), `ora` (ai-cli), `glob` (react-test-harness), `tslib` (ng-bootstrap, which compiles with `importHelpers`), `@auth0/auth0-spa-js` (ng-auth-services), `@memberjunction/core-entities` + `@memberjunction/global` + `@memberjunction/aiengine` (cli), and `@memberjunction/ng-react` (ng-explorer-core, reached from a generated file).

  Two changes are more than a declaration:
  - **`@memberjunction/server`**: `@types/express` moves `^4.17.25` → `^5.0.6`. The package declares `express@^5.2.1` at runtime, so it was only compiling because hoisting supplied the v5 types that six sibling packages declare. The types now match the express it actually runs.
  - **`@memberjunction/ng-auth-services`**: `angularProviderFactory` gains an explicit `Provider[]` return type. Declaring `@auth0/auth0-spa-js` alone does not resolve TS2742 — the emitted declaration file still needed a nameable type rather than one inferred through a transitive package path.
  - **`@memberjunction/scheduled-actions-server`**: drops `@types/axios`, a deprecated stub package that carries no type definitions; its presence made TypeScript auto-include it and then fail to find any types. axios ships its own.

## 5.31.0

### Patch Changes

- 7ed7a4b: no metadata/migration changes
- 28beaa4: Slack/Teams server extensions now skip silently when enabled but unconfigured (placeholder ContextUserEmail or missing tokens) instead of throwing and logging failed to initialize on every MJAPI startup. Adds optional Skipped?: boolean to ExtensionInitResult for extensions to opt into the quiet path; loader emits LogStatus instead of LogError when set. Genuine misconfig (real credentials but unknown email) still throws and logs as an error.
