# @memberjunction/livekit-room-server

## 5.43.0

### Minor Changes

- 9f6aa87: Generic fire-and-forget save queue, realtime multi-agent floor control, and telemetry fixes.

  **Generic fire-and-forget save queue** (`@memberjunction/global`, `@memberjunction/core`, + adopters) — de-duplicates the hand-rolled "INSERT (fire-and-forget) → chained UPDATE" persistence pattern and makes the "stuck at Running" race structurally impossible:
  - `KeyedSerialTaskQueue` (`@memberjunction/global`) — entity-agnostic per-key serial task chain: same-key tasks serialize, different keys run concurrently, failures are tallied for `flush()` and never propagate. Self-bounding (in-flight set + failure counters), so a long-lived queue that never flushes doesn't grow.
  - `BaseEntitySaveQueue` (`@memberjunction/core`) — entity façade: `Insert` / `Update(entity, applyMutation?)` / `Flush`, with an optional `onError` hook for structured logging. `Update`'s mutation runs _inside_ the post-INSERT task, so it can never be reverted by the INSERT's reload.
  - Adopted in all three hand-rolled copies + the new consumer: `GenericProcessRunTracker` (`@memberjunction/record-set-processor`), `AgentRunStepSaveQueue` (`@memberjunction/ai-core-plus`), `ActionEngine`'s execution log (`@memberjunction/actions`), and `AIPromptRunner` / `AIModelRunner` (`@memberjunction/ai-prompts`). Also fixes a pre-existing `MJLruCache` mock gap in the Actions/Engine test suite.

  **Realtime** (`@memberjunction/ai`, `@memberjunction/ai-bridge-server`, `@memberjunction/ai-gemini`, `@memberjunction/ai-openai`, `@memberjunction/livekit-room-server`, `@memberjunction/ng-livekit-room`) — multi-agent floor control, Gemini meeting mode, the session capability surface with first-agent re-gating, and an idle reaper.

  **Telemetry / core** (`@memberjunction/core`, `@memberjunction/server`) — cacheability-aware duplicate-RunView suggestion for `AllowCaching=false` entities; fixes the telemetry pagination-fingerprint false-duplicate and batches the janitor channel reads.

## 5.42.0

### Minor Changes

- 9b9b484: Field active-status enforcement relocation, plus the "Meet" app rename, quieter operational logging, and a telemetry suppression refinement.

  **Field active-status enforcement (`@memberjunction/core`, `@memberjunction/generic-database-provider`)**
  - Deprecated-field warnings and disabled-field exceptions are now enforced at the field-access boundary genuine code flows through — `BaseEntity.Get()`, `Set()`, and `SetMany()` (what the generated strongly-typed accessors call) — instead of on the low-level `EntityField.Value` accessor. This flips a leaky blocklist (assert on every `.Value` touch, then suppress at each internal call site) into a precise allowlist, and fixes false deprecation warnings emitted on every load/save of a record that merely _contains_ a deprecated column (e.g. `"MJ: AI Agent Runs".AgentState`) even when no code uses it.
  - New memoized `EntityInfo.HasInactiveFields` fast-path gate: entities whose fields are all `Active` (the vast majority) pay only a single cached boolean check in the hot read/write paths.
  - `EntityField.ActiveStatusAssertions` is retained as a `@deprecated` no-op for backward compatibility; the six now-redundant internal suppression toggles were removed. Warning caller strings are now accurate (`BaseEntity.Get`/`Set`) instead of the misleading `"EntityField.Value setter"`.

  **Telemetry (`@memberjunction/core`)**
  - Suppress "load this into a dedicated engine cache" telemetry suggestions for entities that have explicitly opted out of caching (`EntityInfo.AllowCaching = false`), reusing the existing flag as the single source of truth.

  **Quieter operational logging (`@memberjunction/scheduling-engine`, `@memberjunction/ai-agents`, `@memberjunction/server`, `@memberjunction/server-bootstrap`, `@memberjunction/server-bootstrap-lite`)**
  - Scheduled-job no-op runs (e.g. the Agent Memory Manager finding no new activity) now collapse to the engine's `Starting`/`Completed` heartbeat; the per-agent and memory-manager internal traces are verbose-only.
  - Cleaner server startup logging: transient boot spinner, true total timing, less redundant output, and the `CustomColumnPromoter` registration log demoted to verbose-only.

  **"Meet" app + local LiveKit dev (`@memberjunction/ng-explorer-core`, `@memberjunction/livekit-room-server`, `@memberjunction/auth-providers`, `@memberjunction/server`)**
  - Renamed the Realtime app to "Meet", with the Live Room now defaulting to the Realtime co-agent instead of starting with no agent, plus a local LiveKit dev server and supporting docs.

- 5fde509: Add the LiveKit room UX stack — a full-featured, framework-portable LiveKit client plus the MJ realtime-bridge binding, server token/egress support, and an Explorer surface.
  - **`@memberjunction/livekit-room-core`** (new): framework-agnostic pure-TS room controller over `livekit-client` — observable room state, participants, active speakers, audio meters, device control, data-channel messages, audio-autoplay unblock, Krisp noise filter, background blur/virtual background, E2EE, room-free media preview, and a deep **cancelable event architecture** (`event.Cancel = true`).
  - **`@memberjunction/ng-livekit-room`** (new): super-featured portable Angular UI (`mj-livekit-room`) — gallery / active-speaker / **split-view (draggable splitter)** / audio-only layouts with a live switcher, A/V/screen controls, data-channel chat, device + settings menu (noise filter / background blur), **PreJoin lobby**, **StartAudio** unblock, click-to-pin, **agent-state visualizer**, **collaborative whiteboard** (reuses `@memberjunction/ng-whiteboard`, synced over the data channel — agent co-authoring supported), recording control, and E2EE. Every feature gated by a PascalCase `@Input`; core events re-surfaced as `@Output`s. MJ design tokens with fallbacks.
  - **`@memberjunction/livekit-room-server`** (new): scoped client/bot token minting (`livekit-server-sdk`), `LiveKitAgentRoomCoordinator` session-start harness (opens a realtime session → `AIBridgeEngine.StartBridgeSession`), and `LiveKitEgressService` recording.
  - **`@memberjunction/ng-mj-livekit-room`** (new): MJ binding (`mj-livekit-agent-room`) resolving tokens / starting agent sessions / recording via the RealtimeBridge GraphQL surface.
  - **`@memberjunction/graphql-dataprovider`**: adds `GraphQLLiveKitClient` (mint token, start agent room session, start/stop recording).
  - **`@memberjunction/server`**: adds `RealtimeBridgeResolver` (`MintLiveKitClientToken`, `StartLiveKitAgentRoomSession`, `StartLiveKitRecording`, `StopLiveKitRecording`).
  - **`@memberjunction/ng-explorer-core`**: registers a `LiveKitRoomResource` so the room can be opened as an Explorer tab.

  Tests: 74 unit tests across the stack (core 22, server 15, ng-livekit-room 26, GraphQL client 6, resolver 5). No migrations. The agent-talking path additionally requires the deployment to bind a realtime-session factory on `LiveKitAgentRoomCoordinator.Instance` and the LiveKit native room client (`@livekit/rtc-node`) — the documented deployment seams.

- 4ec1732: Make the Meet app's LiveKit Live Room work end-to-end (default agent resolution, realtime model fallback, real backing session row, bridge-driver registration, connect timeout, and active device selection), then build it into a multi-party experience: a pre-join agent picker, threading a target agent so the co-agent actually responds, in-room add/remove of agents, and shareable human invite links. Also improves Entity Vector Sync with a concise per-document summary, verbose-gated pipeline logging, and a batched Entity Record Document existence read that replaces an N+1 query storm.

### Patch Changes

- 78f834d: Wire the realtime-session factory so a LiveKit-bridged agent actually talks. Adds `BaseAgent.StartBridgeRealtimeSession()` — opens a raw `IRealtimeSession` for the agent (reusing the same model resolution + system-prompt/memory assembly as the client-direct realtime path, minus the RealtimeSessionRunner since the bridge engine owns turn-taking) — and `CreateBridgeRealtimeSession`, the provider-agnostic factory that resolves the agent + instantiates its `BaseAgent` and calls it. `RealtimeBridgeResolver` binds the factory onto `LiveKitAgentRoomCoordinator` at module load. The coordinator now threads `NativeModuleSpecifier` (default `@memberjunction/ai-bridge-livekit-native`, overridable via `LIVEKIT_NATIVE_MODULE` env / `SetNativeModuleSpecifier`) into the bridge session Configuration so the native room client loads. Completes the agent-talking path for the LiveKit bridge.
