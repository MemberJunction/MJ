   *                     storage provider and may also be included in the pre-authenticated URL.
   * @returns A Promise that resolves to a payload containing the upload URL and, optionally, the

   *
   * **Implementation Guidelines:**
   * - Check for presence of all required configuration values
   * - Do NOT make network calls or expensive operations
   * - Return true only if the provider can be used immediately
   * - Return false if any required configuration is missing or invalid
   *
   * **Examples by Provider:**
   * - Google Drive: Check for clientID, clientSecret, and refreshToken
   * - AWS S3: Check for accessKeyId, secretAccessKey, and bucketName
   * - SharePoint: Check for tenantId, clientId, clientSecret, siteUrl
   * - Azure Blob: Check for connectionString or account credentials
   *
   * @example
   * ```typescript
   * // In Google Drive provider:
   * public get IsConfigured(): boolean {
   *   return !!(this._clientID && this._clientSecret && this._refreshToken);
   * }
   *
   * // In AWS S3 provider:
   * public get IsConfigured(): boolean {
   *   return !!(this._accessKeyId && this._secretAccessKey && this._bucketName);
   * }
   *
   * // Usage:
   * const storage = new GoogleDriveFileStorage();
   * if (storage.IsConfigured) {
   *   // Safe to use this provider
   *   await storage.SearchFiles('query');
   * } else {
   *   console.log('Provider not configured, skipping');
   * }
   * ```
   *
   * @returns true if the provider is fully configured and ready to use, false otherwise

  /**
   * Searches for files across the storage system using the provider's native search capabilities.
   *
   * This method leverages each provider's built-in search APIs to find files matching
   * the specified query. The search can include filenames, file content, and metadata
   * depending on the provider's capabilities and the options specified.
   *
   * **Provider Support:**
   * - **Google Drive**: Full support via Drive API search with content indexing
   * - **SharePoint**: Full support via Microsoft Graph Search API
   * - **Dropbox**: Full support via search_v2 API with content search
   * - **Box**: Full support via Box Search API
   * - **AWS S3**: Not supported - throws UnsupportedOperationError
   * - **Azure Blob**: Not supported - throws UnsupportedOperationError
   * - **Google Cloud Storage**: Not supported - throws UnsupportedOperationError
   *
   * **Query Syntax:**
   * The query parameter accepts natural language search terms. Advanced query syntax
   * (like boolean operators, exact phrases, wildcards) varies by provider:
   * - Google Drive supports: "exact phrase", OR, -, wildcards
   * - SharePoint supports: KQL (Keyword Query Language)
   * - Dropbox supports: exact phrases in quotes
   * - Box supports: boolean AND/OR/NOT operators
   *
   * Implementations should document their specific query syntax support.
   *
   * @example
   * ```typescript
   * // Simple filename search
   * const results = await storage.SearchFiles('quarterly report');
   * for (const file of results.results) {
   *   console.log(`Found: ${file.path} (${file.size} bytes)`);
   * }
   *
   * // Search with filters
   * const pdfResults = await storage.SearchFiles('budget', {
   *   fileTypes: ['pdf'],
   *   modifiedAfter: new Date('2024-01-01'),
   *   pathPrefix: 'documents/finance/',
   *   maxResults: 50
   * });
   *
   * // Content search (if supported)
   * const contentResults = await storage.SearchFiles('machine learning algorithm', {
   *   searchContent: true,
   *   fileTypes: ['docx', 'pdf', 'txt']
   * });
   *
   * // Check if there are more results
   * if (contentResults.hasMore) {
   *   console.log(`Found ${contentResults.totalMatches} total matches`);
   *   console.log(`Use nextPageToken to fetch more results`);
   * }
   * ```
   *
   * @param query - The search query string. Can be a simple term, phrase, or provider-specific
   *                advanced query syntax.
   * @param options - Optional search configuration parameters.
   * @returns A Promise that resolves to a FileSearchResultSet containing matching files.
   * @throws UnsupportedOperationError if the provider doesn't support search operations.
