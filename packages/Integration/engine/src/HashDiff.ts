/**
 * Partitioned / Merkle-style hash-diff (§7 "hash-diff / full-table compare to find changed
 * partitions cheaply when no incremental cursor exists").
 *
 * The problem: some sources have NO usable watermark — they can't tell us "what changed since T"
 * (e.g. YourMembership re-fetches every record every time). Per-record content hashing
 * (`computeContentHash`) already lets us skip the per-record load+write for the unchanged majority,
 * but we still have to FETCH every record to hash it. When the remote can expose a cheap per-PARTITION
 * rollup hash (a folder digest, an aggregated checksum, or just a previously-stored snapshot of one),
 * we can compare partition rollups first and only deep-fetch the partitions whose rollup moved.
 *
 * This module builds the local side of that comparison ON TOP of `computeContentHash`:
 *   1. `partitionRecords`     — bucket records by an arbitrary partition key.
 *   2. `partitionRollupHash`  — fold each bucket's per-record hashes into ONE order-independent digest.
 *   3. `diffPartitions`       — compare two partition→rollup maps; only the differing partitions
 *                               (changed/added/removed) need a deep re-sync.
 *
 * Everything here is pure, deterministic, and free of DB/network — it operates on in-memory
 * record arrays and plain string→string maps, so it is cheaply unit-testable and reusable on either
 * side of the comparison.
