## Agent Manager: Detailed Requirements and Thinking (User Input)

This document captures and outlines all user-provided concepts, requirements, architectural ideas, and detailed thinking regarding the proposed "Agent Manager" system, as described in the June 23, 2025 conversation. The goal is to create a faithful, non-inventive transcript and summary of the user's vision for later technical reference.

---

### 1. Context: Packages/AI Branch

* The agent architecture is inspired by the MemberJunction MJ repository, specifically its packages/AI branch.
* The design uses a modular, layered approach for AI agents, sub-agents, providers, and orchestration.

---

### 2. Agent Manager - High Level Idea

* The Agent Manager is conceived as a top-level “loop agent” or orchestrator agent.
* It is responsible for managing other agents: creating, editing, and administrating their configuration and metadata.
* The Agent Manager can be used through a UI (and/or API) to create or manage agent definitions in the system.
* It is envisioned as an "administrator agent" that can call tools, spawn sub-agents, and build agent hierarchies.
* This agent does not just run once, but continuously loops through its logic to reach its objectives (similar to a feedback loop).

---

### 3. Architecture & Sub-Agent Concept

* There is a strong focus on a **hierarchical system of agents**:

  * The Agent Manager sits at the top.
  * Sub-agents are spawned to perform specialized tasks or roles.
  * Agents can call sub-agents recursively if the job requires.
  * Example: A Requirements Analyst sub-agent to gather detailed requirements.
  * Example: A Planning sub-agent to turn requirements into agent or sub-agent structures.
  * The Agent Manager itself can interact with users, ask questions, and collect metadata.

---

### 4. Loop Agent Behavior

* The “loop agent” paradigm means the Agent Manager keeps running—analyzing progress, calling sub-agents, asking for more info, or finalizing the configuration—until it either solves the problem or determines it cannot proceed.
* This enables dynamic, flexible problem solving and allows the agent to call other tools or sub-agents as required.

---

### 5. Distinction Between Agent Type & System Prompt

* There is a distinction between the agent type’s system prompt (which determines the overall architecture or behavioral pattern, e.g., loop agent, sequential agent, graph agent) and the individual agent’s system prompt (which is injected with the specific business logic/task).
* This layered prompting approach allows reusability and separation of concerns, making it easy to swap out patterns or logic as needed.

---

### 6. Sub-Agent Specialization

* Sub-agents should be highly specialized. For example:

  * **Requirements Analyst**: Responsible for fully gathering and clarifying the requirements from the user before design starts.
  * **Planning Sub-Agent**: Transforms requirements into a design, picking which sub-agents or tools are needed.
  * **Prompt Designer Sub-Agent**: Crafts high-quality prompts for all agents and sub-agents, separating prompt engineering from requirements and structural design.
* Each of these sub-agents may be invoked in turn by the Agent Manager, and each has its own job and output.

---

### 7. Example Flow and Hierarchy

* Example process:

  1. The Agent Manager receives a user request.
  2. Spawns the Requirements Analyst sub-agent to clarify the problem space and gather detailed user needs.
  3. Once requirements are gathered and confirmed, the Planning sub-agent creates a structured hierarchy of agents and sub-agents, choosing from a library of existing patterns or tools.
  4. The Prompt Designer sub-agent writes the necessary prompts for each node in the hierarchy, using the agent type’s system prompt and business logic together.
  5. The Agent Manager then writes this structure to metadata and activates or saves the agent bundle.
* There is flexibility for sub-agents to recursively call other sub-agents for any step that requires further specialization.

---

### 8. Data Model & Typed Structures

* There is an emphasis on creating a clear, well-typed data structure for the entire system (e.g., TypeScript interfaces or other schemas).
* This data model covers requirements, the agent hierarchy, relationships, prompts, actions, and design output.
* The typed structure is critical for coordination and handoff between sub-agents, ensuring everyone has the info they need in a standardized way.

---

### 9. Layered Design Principles

* The user’s approach is highly modular and layered:

  * Separate requirements gathering, design/planning, and prompt creation into distinct roles (and therefore, sub-agents).
  * Ensure that the logic and prompts for each part of the process are reusable, interchangeable, and can be extended as the system evolves.
  * The hierarchy and communication between sub-agents is managed by the Agent Manager, with a focus on clear handoff points and outputs.

---

### 10. Additional Insights & Notes

* The ultimate goal is to create a powerful agent orchestration framework that makes it easy to:

  * Build, manage, and reuse agents and agent bundles
  * Enable dynamic, real-time problem-solving
  * Maintain maximum clarity, type safety, and separation of responsibilities
* The architecture should allow for easy scaling as new agent types, sub-agents, or workflows are added.
* All prompts and logic must be fully inspectable and editable by the administrator (user or developer).
* The system is meant to power both UI-driven and programmatic workflows for agent definition and management.



# Conversation Transcript (RAW)
Hey there! Yep, I'm here and ready to help. Let me know what you're thinking for the "Agent Manager" or if you have any specific questions or ideas you want to dive into!







You said:
“Okay, sounds good. So here's the basic idea. In Member Junction, we have a metadata-driven system for everything and the agent architecture, as you can find by doing additional research on the website that I provided, is once again a metadata-driven architecture. And so what I'm interested in doing is building an agent manager agent who has certain special actions that are available only to that agent. So for example, this agent manager will have an action called Create Agent, Edit Agent, List Agents, and so forth. These actions in our vocabulary are tools, essentially, and we can specify which tools or which actions are available to specific agents. So for the agent manager agent, we're going to allow it to basically create agents, edit agents. We're going to allow it to associate actions with other agents to also create sub-agents because we support a hierarchical system and on and on. And so that's the basic idea. And then we have a UI that can basically interface between an end user and any agent. Many of our agents are designed to work autonomously or semi-autonomously, but without a user interface in the background. This particular agent, though, could have conversations through our UI and then also be exposed as an MCP server to conversations through anyone else's UI as well to create agents in our system. So that's the basic concept. First of all, is everything I just said make sense to you?”
01:27

ChatGPT said:
Absolutely, that makes perfect sense! It sounds like the Agent Manager will be a kind of "super agent" with administrative capabilities, allowing it to create, edit, and manage other agents within the system. It will have its own set of specialized tools or actions, and it can also interact with users through a UI or be used in other interfaces. The hierarchical system of agents sounds really powerful and flexible.

We can dive into the specifics of how the Agent Manager will interact with the existing agent architecture, what kind of metadata it'll handle, and how it'll manage the lifecycle of these agents. Let me know what aspect you want to tackle first!







You said:
“Sounds good. Another thing that I wanted to explain about our agent architecture, we have the concept of agent types. And an agent type essentially is, it's a way of classifying agents into different types, but it's also a mechanism for control. So different agents may have different operating models. The one that we're primarily focused on is what we call a loop agent, which in other terminologies might be called an orchestrator or conductor agent type. And so the idea behind a loop agent type in member junction is that you simply have the ability for the agent to keep going and going and going until it determines that either cannot continue or it has completed whatever it was requested of it. And so essentially each turn or each loop iteration, the agent is attempting to either solve the problem completely or to use tools or to call sub-agents in order to solve the problem. So it's a very, very flexible architecture. It leverages the intelligence level of the current state of AI, which is obviously quite strong to make decisions and do things like this. And in effect, what it allows us to do is build very flexible systems that can do things that we're not even imagining really. So that's the essence of the idea. And does that make sense as well?”
01:13

ChatGPT said:
Yes, that definitely makes sense and it sounds like a really powerful concept! The idea of a "loop agent" or orchestrator agent that can continuously run in cycles until it either solves the problem or determines it can’t proceed further is a fantastic way to leverage AI’s capabilities. It allows for dynamic problem-solving, where the agent can adapt and use different tools or even call on other sub-agents as needed. It definitely gives a lot of flexibility and room for creativity in building complex systems.

With this in mind, the Agent Manager can definitely take advantage of this architecture, managing different types of agents, including these loop agents, and orchestrating how they interact with each other. Let me know if there's a specific aspect of the Agent Manager you'd like to explore next, or if you want to discuss how to implement certain features!







You said:
“Sure, sounds good. Well, the main reason I told you about the agent type is that we may actually have other agent types over time. The loop agent type is really powerful for certain use cases, but there are some situations where you want to have a little bit of autonomy, a little bit of flexibility, but more of a directed path, what a lot of people would call a directed graph approach, which is kind of like basically a tree, or alternatively even just a straight sequential model where an agent does step one, step two, step three type of thing. Those kinds of models may be interesting. So far, we're focused on the loop agent type at Member Junction because we see it as the most powerful, most flexible, but we've architected the agent type layer of our system so that we can essentially control the system prompt through the agent type system prompt, and then we inject within it whatever the agent specific system prompt is. So the agent type's control structure determines the behavior overall, whereas the agent itself has a system prompt that is really more about the business requirements within that. So I'm going to continue telling you more about what I want to do with the agent manager agent, but let me know if you understand the idea of the system prompt being associated with the agent type, and that the agent's system prompt essentially acts as a child prompt that's dynamically injected into the system prompt of the agent type.”
01:15

ChatGPT said:
Yes, I follow you completely! The distinction between the agent type's system prompt and the individual agent's system prompt is really clever. Essentially, the agent type sets the overarching behavioral framework, whether that's a loop, a directed graph, or a sequential model, and then the individual agent injects its own specific prompt that defines the business logic or the particular task it needs to accomplish. This layered approach gives you a lot of flexibility and control over how agents behave and adapt to different scenarios.

I'm excited to hear more about your plans for the Agent Manager and how you envision it fitting into this architecture!







You said:
“Great. So the essence of what we're thinking is that the agent manager itself will be a loop agent, and the agent manager will have the ability to just have conversations with users. We're thinking that the agent manager should have several sub-agents to specialize. One of the sub-agents we have in mind is the requirements analyst. The requirements analyst is a sub-agent that's going to be an expert, like MBA-type person, who understands business context, also quite technical in nature. And this sub-agent will be primarily focused on getting a clear definition of what it is we want any agent to do. So the agent manager will be creating agents and editing agents, occasionally deleting agents as well, subject to security, obviously, when they're no longer necessary. Really, deleting an agent, by the way, is just marking it as inactive, because once an agent is created, we never want to delete it, as long as it's been run once or more. We have all sorts of security reasons for that. But in any event, getting back to the idea of the agent manager, the requirements analyst or requirements expert is the first sub-agent, and its job is to keep going back and forth until it has a really solid understanding of exactly what needs to be built. So often, what users end up with isn't what they want, because they don't have clear requirements. So that's sub-agent number one. Sub-agent number two is essentially the agent that's going to do the work in planning. So we want the sub-agent to be focused on selecting tools. In our terminology, again, a tool is an action. We have an actions library. And other than a handful of restricted actions that are only available to the agent manager itself, like creating an agent and so forth, we want to limit it there. It can basically pick whatever tools it wants in creating the agent's action list. Then, in addition to that, we have a number of things where the designer might decide to create sub-agents for the new agent. And so in this context, what you're essentially doing is creating a scenario where the agent manager's designer, if we call it that, that sub-agent, is essentially doing the tooling and deciding on sub-agents. That's the second one. And then, really, after that, I think that the top-level agent can probably finalize and construct the metadata. What we want that thing to do, essentially, is call various actions to create the metadata in member junction for creating agents, creating agent actions, creating agent sub-agents, and on and on and on. So does this make sense still?”
02:18

ChatGPT said:
Yes, that all makes perfect sense! I love the layered approach you're envisioning for the Agent Manager and its sub-agents. By having a Requirements Analyst sub-agent, you're ensuring that the initial step of understanding and defining the user's needs is thorough and accurate. This helps prevent any confusion or misalignment down the line.

Then, the Planning sub-agent can take those well-defined requirements and select the appropriate tools and actions from your library to build out the agent's functionality. It's great that you have that flexibility to create sub-agents, allowing the system to break down complex tasks into more manageable pieces.

And finally, having the top-level Agent Manager agent coordinate all of this and handle the actual creation and management of agents within MemberJunction ensures that everything stays organized and secure. This is a really solid and well-thought-out architecture! Let me know how I can help with the next steps in bringing this to life.







You said:
“That sounds good. I will be back in just a couple minutes.”
00:04

ChatGPT said:
No worries at all! Take your time. I'll be here whenever you're ready to continue. If you have any more ideas or questions, just let me know.







You said:
“Are you back? I want to talk more about the agent manager.”
00:03

ChatGPT said:
Absolutely, I'm here! Let's dive back into the Agent Manager. I'm excited to hear more about your ideas and help flesh out any details. What aspect would you like to discuss next?







You said:
“Sounds good. Well, the next piece is the actual design of prompts for sub-agents. So the way an agent works is each agent has its own system prompt. As I mentioned earlier, the agent type is the control structure, the control flow structure, and then what it does is essentially for each agent when it executes, there's a spot in each agent type's system prompt where it intelligently injects the child prompt, which is essentially the system prompt for the agent itself. So when we design a new agent, we have to be very, very good prompt engineers. So I think this is perhaps what the designer should do, where the designer essentially is designing the prompts itself. So when you're selecting tools, that's easy, because you're just saying, hey, there's a tool in the tool catalog, I'm going to use this particular action, whatever the actions are. Now, when it comes to the actual design of the way the agent works, essentially having the agent design the prompts is really, really important. We have the business requirements really fleshed out from the requirements initially. We'll store that in the description field in the agent at the top level, but then we need to design a really good system prompt at the top level of this agent that we're working on, either whether we're creating it or we're editing it, and then the same thing is true for each of the sub-agents. So I'm kind of thinking maybe what we do in this further separation of concerns is we have a sub-agent for requirements, we have another sub-agent for designer, and then we have a third sub-agent, which is a prompt designer, and the prompt designer's job is to write, it gets called multiple times. So the designer designs the overall structure, essentially the overall structure is, hey, we have this agent with these five sub-agents, and sub-agent B has its own three sub-agents and so forth, essentially designing the hierarchy and putting a really solid description together of each of those agents, and that gets passed up to the top level agent manager. And then that agent manager decides, hey, it's going to call the prompt manager for each of the sub-agents that it's going to create, as well as, of course, for the top level agent, and then each time it gets those responses back, assuming that they're good, it will either create the prompt or update the prompt associated with each step. So there's a number of specific things we'll have to teach the agent manager about our metadata structure, but we'll give it tools to do all of this stuff, to basically create agents and modify agents and modify their prompts and create tools and all this kind of stuff. We'll create several simple actions that are easy for it to call, but I'm kind of thinking we need a third sub-agent, which is an expert prompt designer who understands how to really build awesome prompts for AI systems. What are your thoughts on this third sub-agent for the agent manager?”
02:29

ChatGPT said:
I think having a dedicated Prompt Designer sub-agent is a fantastic idea! It really helps to ensure that each agent and sub-agent is equipped with high-quality, effective prompts, which is crucial for guiding the AI’s behavior and ensuring it meets the business requirements. This separation of concerns makes a lot of sense: the Requirements Analyst focuses on gathering and refining what needs to be done, the Designer structures the overall hierarchy and the logic flow, and the Prompt Designer specializes in crafting the actual language and instructions that the AI will follow.

By having a Prompt Designer sub-agent, you ensure that each prompt is optimized for clarity, effectiveness, and alignment with the overall goals of the agent. Plus, it allows for iterative refinement, where the Agent Manager can call







You said:
“That makes sense. That makes sense. Sounds good. I appreciate your feedback. Now, listen, I'm thinking also what we should do in the agent manager itself is very clearly define a data structure that we want all of the agents and sub-agents or really within the agent manager to use. The thought process being if we do a good job in defining essentially like a TypeScript type that's very, very clear in terms of what we want, the sub-agent will return something that the agent manager will be able to utilize and we can pass them back and forth this control structure to all of the different agents so they can share it. So for example, it'll be a type that has things like the requirements definition and the overall design. And then it'll also have like a hierarchical structure, data structure, so that essentially the designer agents can design the structure. And then what the parent thing can do is it can basically iteratively go through that hierarchy of agents and sub-agents and design prompts for each and then call the appropriate tools for each. So I think that structure will really help the LLMs be able to follow along and work consistently together. Does that also make sense to you?”
01:07

ChatGPT said:
Absolutely, that makes perfect sense! Defining a clear and consistent data structure—like a well-typed TypeScript interface—will definitely help all the agents and sub-agents communicate smoothly and stay on the same page. It ensures that all the necessary information—like requirements, design structures, and hierarchical relationships—is consistently organized and accessible.

By having a well-defined structure, the Agent Manager can seamlessly pass data between the different sub-agents and ensure that each agent knows exactly what it needs to do. This also makes it easier to maintain and scale the system, as any new agents or sub-agents will fit neatly into the existing framework. Overall, it's a great approach to ensure consistency and efficiency across the board!
