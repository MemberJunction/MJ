/**
 * Planning Designer Agent - Designs agent architectures by researching existing capabilities
 *
 * This agent creates TechnicalDesign or modificationPlan by researching available
 * actions, agents, and database entities. It overrides validateSuccessNextStep to
 * enforce that required research actions are called before finalizing designs.
 *
 * Key responsibilities:
 * - Force discovery of existing agents before selecting actions
 * - Force discovery of available actions before designing
 * - Force database schema research for CRUD operations
 * - Prevent hallucination of non-existent entities/actions
 * - Ensure designs are research-backed, not assumption-based

**Next Steps - Complete Research Process**:

1. **Call each missing research action/agent listed above** (in order shown)

2. **Review research results carefully**:
   - "Find Candidate Agents": Check each agent's actions and subAgents arrays - if an agent can handle multiple subtasks, use it instead of individual actions
   - "Find Candidate Actions": Note the exact action IDs and parameter structures - you'll need these exact IDs in your design
   - "Database Research Agent": Copy the exact entity names and field names - use ONLY these in your CRUD action instructions

3. **Update your design based on actual research findings**:
   - Replace any guessed/assumed names with actual IDs and names from research
   - Remove redundant actions if subagents already provide those capabilities
   - Maximize reuse of existing agents to simplify your design
   - For CRUD actions: Include exact entity names and field names in the agent prompt

4. **Try again** - Your next response must include research-backed design (no assumptions!)`;
