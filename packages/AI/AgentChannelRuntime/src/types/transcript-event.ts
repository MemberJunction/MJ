/**
 * `ChannelTranscriptEvent` — runtime-level transcript notification emitted by
 * a channel engine for transport-out display (widget transcript pane,
 * actionable-command chips, debugging logs).
 *
 * Why a callback (rather than a returned `AsyncIterable`): engines already
 * own their per-turn state machine and the events fire from multiple paths
 * (STT finals, message-field extractor output, post-execution payload).
 * A callback keeps wiring local to each emission site without forcing the
 * engine to maintain a pending-event buffer.
 *
 * The callback is provided by the caller (the GraphQL resolver in MJServer
 * publishes these to a `CHANNEL_TRANSCRIPT` pubsub topic for the voice
 * widget). The runtime itself stays transport-agnostic — it doesn't know
 * about GraphQL, PubSub, or any specific subscriber.
 *
 * Discriminated by `Kind`:
 *
 *  - `user`           — what the user said/typed this turn. Final transcripts
 *                       arrive once per turn.
 *  - `assistant-text` — partial assistant text as the message-field extractor
 *                       emits it from the streaming JSON envelope. May fire
 *                       many times per turn; concatenate on the consumer side.
 *  - `agent-response` — full structured response after `BaseAgent.Execute()`
 *                       returns. Carries `ActionableCommands` for the chip
 *                       UI and the final assembled `Message` for display.
 *  - `error`          — surface a turn-level error (e.g. agent execution
 *                       failure) without taking down the session.
