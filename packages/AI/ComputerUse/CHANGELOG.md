### Patch Changes

- 07cb22e: Fix `$`-sequence corruption in `String.prototype.replace` calls carrying runtime data (#3171).

  `replace(search, replacement)` treats `$$`, `$&`, `` $` ``, `$'` and `$1`–`$99` as metacharacters when `replacement` is a **string**. Every site below passed runtime data there, so a `$` in that data was silently executed rather than inserted. The `$&`/`` $` ``/`$'` forms are worse than value corruption: they splice surrounding text _into_ the value. All are fixed by passing a replacement **function**, whose return value is used literally.
  - **`@memberjunction/installer` — corrupted secrets (highest impact).** Re-running `mj install` syncs the root `.env` into MJAPI's. A DB password containing `$&` had the _stale_ MJAPI password spliced into it; ``$` `` spliced in the preceding `.env` line. The result was a wrong secret written to disk with no error, surfacing later as "MJAPI can't connect". Only the replace branch was affected — fresh installs (append branch, string concatenation) were always correct, which is why this survived. Also fixes the `newUserSetup` block (embeds user name/email) and the `mjRepoVersion` and Explorer `environment.ts` patchers.
  - **`@memberjunction/core` — rewritten RLS predicates.** `RowLevelSecurityFilterInfo.MarkupFilterText` substitutes user properties, magic-link scope and `{{Acting*}}` tokens into row-level-security filters. A `$` in any of them rewrote the predicate — the exact outcome the neighbouring `'`-escaping exists to prevent. This feeds `GetEffectiveRowFilterWhereClause`, used across RunView reads, Create and Update. Also fixes organic-key `Custom` normalization, which builds a SQL `WHERE` from a data value.
  - **`@memberjunction/generic-database-provider`, `@memberjunction/postgresql-dataprovider`** — end-user search terms substituted into `UserSearchParamFormatAPI` predicates, plus view-template inner SQL and PG identifier quoting. Also `QueryCompositionEngine.renameSQLIdentifier`, which rewrites CTE identifiers in composed queries: the search side was regex-escaped but the replacement side was not, so a `$` in a deconflicted CTE name (SQL Server bracketed and PG quoted identifiers both permit one) was expanded into the executed SQL.
  - **`@memberjunction/ai-prompts`, `@memberjunction/computer-use`, `@memberjunction/ai-vector-sync`, `@memberjunction/aiengine`, `@memberjunction/ai-agents`** — assistant prefill text (routinely contains `$$` for LaTeX or currency), computer-use goals/URLs/step summaries, embedding-document field values, and entity field values, all interpolated into prompts and templates.
  - **`@memberjunction/metadata-sync`** — parameter values in the debug SQL log.
  - **`@memberjunction/testing-engine`** — test input/expected/actual values into the LLM-judge prompt, and parameter values into `SQLValidatorOracle`'s generated SQL.
  - **`@memberjunction/sql-converter`** — the configured schema name substituted into emitted PostgreSQL view SQL, in both `ViewRule` and its previously-missed twin in `InsertRule`. The schema is now escaped on the _search_ side too: a `$` in it acted as an end-anchor, so the pattern matched nothing and the conversion silently emitted no rewrite.
  - **`@memberjunction/sql-parser`** — `restoreAliases` swaps generated aliases back to the caller's original bracketed identifiers. Two of its three branches used `split`/`join` and were already safe; the third expanded `$`-sequences, so `[a$'b]` spliced surrounding SQL into an identifier. The aliasing path fires precisely _because_ an identifier contains a non-word character, so the input that triggers aliasing is the input that corrupted the restore. Reached from the public `ToSQL()`.
  - **`@memberjunction/sqlserver-dataprovider`** — batch execution rewrites `@name` placeholders to `@q<N>_name`; the parameter name went into the `RegExp` unescaped, so a `$` in it prevented the rewrite entirely and mssql failed with "Must declare the scalar variable". Sibling of the PostgreSQL `escapeRegExp` fix below.
  - **`@memberjunction/react-linter`** — component data substituted into diagnostic messages.
  - **`@memberjunction/actions-bizapps-social`, `@memberjunction/ai-cli`** — hardened a numeric-only site; documented the AICLI JSON highlighter's `$1` back-references as intentional.

  Also fixes a **test-tooling safety defect** found while verifying the above on a clean database: `@memberjunction/testing-cli` loaded `.env` with `dotenv.config({ override: true })`, so a variable already set in the environment was overwritten. `DB_DATABASE=MJ_scratch mj test …` was silently discarded and the suite ran — **including mutation tests** — against whatever `.env` pointed at. That made the "one database per agent" rule unenforceable by environment variable and diverged from every other `mj` command (`migrate`, `codegen`, `sync push` all honour the environment). `override` is now dotenv's default `false`, so `.env` still fills in anything unset but an explicit value wins. Guarded by a unit test. **Note the inverse hazard when upgrading:** any environment that exports `DB_*` globally — a Docker image, a CI container, a stale `export` in a shell profile — now wins over `.env`, where `.env` used to be authoritative. If a `mj test` run suddenly targets an unexpected database, check the exported environment first; the CLI prints `config.dbDatabase: <name>` at startup.

  And an adjacent defect found while testing the above: `PostgreSQLDataProvider.quoteFieldNamesInToken` interpolated a field name into a `RegExp` **without escaping regex metacharacters**, so a column named `a.b` matched (and wrongly quoted) unrelated text like `axb`, and a column containing `$` was never matched at all — which had also made the replacement-side fix on that line unreachable. Field names are now escaped before interpolation.

  Also adds `.github/scripts/check-dynamic-replace.mjs`, a CI gate that flags `.replace()`/`.replaceAll()` whose replacement is neither a string literal nor a function. No existing lint rule covered this — the React `string-replace-all-occurrences` rule only ever inspects the _search_ argument. The gate is line-aware (only lines a change touches), since ~100 pre-existing sites remain and a bare identifier holding a function reference is indistinguishable from one holding a string; `--all` is available for auditing. Regression tests now push `$$`, `$&`, `` $` ``, `$'` and `$1` through each fixed path.

  Also fixes a **silently inert security check** found while verifying the above. `BaseTestDriver.Provider` fell back to `new Metadata() as unknown as IMetadataProvider`. `Metadata` is a facade that proxies a hand-maintained subset of members to the global provider, not a provider itself, and the cast is the only reason the compiler accepted it. Members it does not proxy read `undefined` — `RowLevelSecurityFilters` among them. The integration suite's `discoverTokenFilter` reads exactly that property to find a `{{UserID}}`-scoped filter, so it always found none: the `rls-isolation` RLS1/RLS2 token-substitution checks skipped-as-pass **on every database**, while the bundle reported green. There were 13 filters present, 5 of them `{{UserID}}`-scoped. The fallback now returns the global provider, which is what the getter's own doc comment always promised, and both checks now execute. A new `rls-isolation` check (RLS11) additionally pushes `$$`, `$&`, `` $` ``, `$'` and `$1` through a substituted user property and executes the resulting predicate, so the RLS half of this fix has live coverage rather than unit coverage alone.

## 5.42.0

### Patch Changes

- 3080b58: Computer Use goal loop now defaults to the stored metadata prompts + their model selection, and the prompt text is single-sourced across both layers.
  - **Default flip:** `MJComputerUseEngine.Run` defaults the controller + judge to the stored `Computer Use - Controller` / `Computer Use - Judge` metadata prompts (via new `DEFAULT_CONTROLLER_PROMPT_NAME` / `DEFAULT_JUDGE_PROMPT_NAME`) when the caller pins neither a prompt nor a model — routing through `AIPromptRunner` with the prompt's configured models (default Gemini 3.1 Flash-Lite → Gemini 3.5 Flash → Claude Haiku 4.5 → GPT 5.5, each on two vendors for failover). Resolution order: explicit override → stored default prompt → `autoSelectControllerModel()` (non-throwing fallback, so standalone/no-metadata callers degrade cleanly). Model choice is now a metadata edit, not code.
  - **Single source of truth:** the behavioral core of the controller/judge prompts lives once in `metadata/prompts/templates/computer-use/_includes/*.md`, pulled into the Layer-2 metadata templates via the push-time `{@include}` directive and generated into the Layer-1 standalone fallback (`@memberjunction/computer-use`) by a `prebuild` (`scripts/generate-prompt-parts.mjs` → `prompt-parts.generated.ts`). A drift-guard test asserts both layers stay in sync.
  - READMEs (computer-use-engine, computer-use, remote-browser-cdp/server) and `REMOTE_BROWSER_GUIDE.md` §9e updated.

- e4235fd: Add clipboard paste-in and copy-out to the remote-browser human-control (Self-Hosted Chrome canvas viewer), which previously couldn't bridge the local and remote clipboards.
  - **Paste-in:** a new `'text'` `RemoteBrowserHumanInput` kind, mapped (CDP) to the existing text-insertion path (`TypeAction` / `Input.insertText`) — no clipboard sync needed. The viewer captures the local `paste`, reads `clipboardData`, and relays the text to the remote page's focused element.
  - **Copy-out:** a new capability-gated `IRemoteBrowserSession.GetSelectionText()` (CDP `page.evaluate(window.getSelection())`) + a `GetRemoteBrowserSelection` GraphQL query; the viewer captures the local `copy`, fetches the remote selection, and writes it to the local clipboard via `navigator.clipboard.writeText` (best-effort, gated on `HumanTakeover`).

  Lets a human controlling the remote browser paste credentials in and copy text out. Tests added for the `'text'` mapping, `GetSelectionText`, and the channel relay.

## 5.41.0

### Minor Changes

- a5f5472: Remote Browser channel + new realtime voice providers + computer-use enrichment.
  - **Remote Browser channel** (`@memberjunction/remote-browser-*`): an in-house realtime channel where an agent drives a live, CDP-connected browser while it talks (sales demos, support walkthroughs, trainer agents). New `AIRemoteBrowserProvider` registry (migration V202606161000) with JSONType capability gating; a universal `remote-browser-base` (driver family + `RemoteBrowserEngineBase`), a shared `remote-browser-cdp` kit (one lossless action mapper + `CdpRemoteBrowserSession`), a `remote-browser-server` engine + `RemoteBrowserChannel` (control arbiter, control modes AgentOnly/ViewOnly/Collaborative vs strategies ComputerUse/NativeAI), and five thin backends (Self-Hosted Chrome, Browserbase, Steel, Browserless, Hyperbrowser).
  - **computer-use** enriched additively into a complete browser-I/O + perception engine: CSS-selector-aware actions, CDP screencast, MouseMove, accessibility-snapshot/QueryElement/GetVisibleText/GetTitle/WaitForLoadState — every consumer benefits, existing vision/coordinate path unchanged.
  - **New realtime model providers**: xAI Grok Voice (`@memberjunction/ai-xai`, OpenAI-Realtime-compatible) and Inworld (`@memberjunction/ai-inworld`), with vendor/model seeds.
  - **Console logging improvements** across `@memberjunction/ai-core-plus`, `ai-engine-base`, `ai-prompts`, `aiengine`, `cli`, `generic-database-provider`, `metadata-sync`, and the bootstrap/forms packages.

## 5.39.0

### Patch Changes

- f1e52fa: Propagate external Playwright/CDP attach support up through ComputerUse and MJComputerUse. Adds optional `Connect` / `ConnectType` / `ReuseExistingContext` fields to `BrowserConfig`, threads attach mode through both `PlaywrightBrowserAdapter` and `HeadlessBrowserEngine`, and exposes the same three fields on `ComputerUseTestConfig` so test-driver configs can declare attach mode declaratively. Ownership tracking ensures `Close()`/`Shutdown()` never tear down a browser or context the caller owns. All fields are optional — existing callers are unaffected.

Includes ephemeral workspace guard for cross-test isolation and stabilizes the suite at 25/25.
- 48dc77a: Add full-stack regression test suite for MJ Explorer driven by the Computer Use engine. New `Drag` browser action with smooth multi-step mouse motion, parallel browser worker contexts shared across tests with auto-rotation after 20 uses, JSON-on-disk run comparison via `mj test compare --from-json`, and `--dry-run` / `--parallel` / `--flaky-check` flags on the testing CLI.
