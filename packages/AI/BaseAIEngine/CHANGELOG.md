### Minor Changes

- 1a2ce13: Pricing for models that aren't billed by the token, and OpenAI as a second Whisper provider.

  **The problem.** MJ's pricing _schema_ was always general — a cost row names a price unit type, and the unit type names a `DriverClass` the ClassFactory resolves. The _execution layer_ was not: `BasePriceUnitType` took two token counts, only the three token drivers were ever registered, and `MJAIPromptRunEntityServer` refused to cost any run reporting zero tokens. So the three continuous-media unit types that already shipped — `Per Image`, `Per Minute`, `Per Hour` — resolved to nothing, and every run priced by one was silently uncosted. Six ACTIVE image cost rows were in that state. (Bug register B60.)

  Speech-to-text made it concrete: Groq bills Whisper by the audio-hour, the just-landed `GroqAudioGenerator` requested `response_format: 'json'` which discards the duration entirely, and the two Whisper models shipped with no cost rows because there was no honest way to write one.

  **Usage grows a second axis.** `ModelUsage` gains `unitKind` (`'Tokens' | 'Seconds' | 'Characters' | 'Images'`), `inputUnits` and `outputUnits`, plus a `ModelUsage.ForMedia(kind, input, output?)` constructor. Continuous quantities are deliberately _not_ folded into the token fields: a run reporting 90 "tokens" that means 90 minutes corrupts `TokensUsed`, every rollup above it, and every dashboard downstream. `SpeechResult` gains `usage?`, matching `ImageGenerationResult`.

  Quantities are always recorded in the **base** measure, never the billing measure — audio billed per hour is still recorded in seconds, and the driver converts. That is what lets one measured duration be priced against a per-minute row from one vendor and a per-hour row from another.

  **Pricing takes quantities.** `BasePriceUnitType` gains a `UnitKind` getter (defaulting to `'Tokens'`, so external subclasses need no change) and `CalculateCost(activeCost, usage)`, the preferred entry point — its default delegates to the existing cache-aware path, so every current driver behaves identically. `TimePerMinutePriceUnitType`, `TimePerHourPriceUnitType` and `PerImagePriceUnitType` register against the unit types that were already seeded, closing the driver half of B60.

  Each driver also exposes `UnitsPerBillingUnit` — 1,000,000 for a per-million-token rate, 3,600 for per-hour, 1 for per-image — so a divisor exists in exactly one place per driver. `TOKEN_PRICE_UNIT_TYPE_DIVISORS` is _derived_ from the driver instances rather than restated, which makes drift between the exported table and the arithmetic that prices every run impossible instead of merely detectable. The map deliberately covers only the token drivers: a missing key is the signal for a consumer doing token-rate math to SKIP a row priced by audio duration, not to fall back to a per-token divisor.

  `BasePriceUnitType` is marked `@RequiresSubclass()`. `ClassFactory.CreateInstance` has never returned `null` for an unregistered key — it falls back to `new BaseClass(...)` — so `if (!calculator)` was a dead branch that installed a hollow object whose only pricing method is `undefined`, surfacing as a `TypeError` inside cost math rather than "this driver is not registered". The new `UnitKind` default made that hollow instance _more_ convincing, since it answers `'Tokens'` and so passes the measure check before throwing. `GetPriceCalculator` now resolves via `TryCreateInstance` and reports the failure, so its documented `null` return is real.

  `AIEngineBase.CalculateModelCost(modelID, vendorID, usage)` is a new costing surface for callers holding a result but no prompt run — transcription and image actions, downstream apps. It returns `null`, having logged why, when there is no active cost row in the measure the run recorded, no registered driver, or a mismatch between what the run measured and what the row prices. A null means "we don't know what this cost" and must never be read as zero.

  **Cost-row selection is measure-aware.** `GetActiveModelCost` takes an optional `usageKind` and excludes rows priced in any other measure before the most-recently-started tiebreak. Without it the effective key is `(Model, Vendor, ProcessingType)`, which cannot represent a model billing in two measures — per-image output alongside per-token prompt — so which measure you got was a sort-order coin flip that was then refused downstream and reported as a pricing gap. The measure is now established _before_ a row is chosen. Omitting the argument keeps the previous behaviour, and no shipped model+vendor carries two measures today, so nothing changes for existing data.

  **The measure is a first-class row, not a string.** A new `MJ: AI Usage Types` entity (`Tokens`, `Seconds`, `Characters`, `Images`) is what a run and a price unit type point at, so "what does this price buy" is answerable by a join instead of by convention. An earlier revision carried it as `AIPromptRun.UnitsKind NVARCHAR(20)` behind a CHECK constraint, which made the set of measures a property of a constraint on one column: nothing else in the schema could reference a measure, and adding one meant editing a CHECK on a table with nothing to do with pricing.

  Note the usage type and the price unit type answer **different** questions and stay separate: `AIUsageType` is the BASE measure of a quantity, while `AIModelPriceUnitType` is the BILLING unit and its scale. Audio is recorded in `Seconds` and billed `Per Hour`. Collapsing them would force a new usage type per billing granularity.

  **The measure lives on `AIModelPriceUnitType`, and nowhere else.** It gains `UsageTypeID` — so a cost row has exactly one place to look for its measure, reached through its `UnitTypeID`, and the FK there means whatever it finds is a real catalog row rather than a string. `AIModelCost` deliberately carries **no** usage-type column: it would be a second copy of a derivable fact, and nothing would arbitrate a cost row claiming `Seconds` while its unit type says `Tokens` — which is precisely the comparison the safety checks depend on. Single-sourcing makes that contradiction unrepresentable rather than merely unlikely.

  **The divisor becomes data, which closes B60's class rather than its instance.** `AIModelPriceUnitType.UnitsPerBillingUnit` (`CHECK > 0`) holds the number that converts base measure to billed unit — 1,000,000 for per-1M-tokens, 3,600 for per-hour, 1 for per-image. That number previously existed _only_ inside a TypeScript class, and that is the root cause of B60: `Per Image` / `Per Minute` / `Per Hour` were seeded as data by one person while the driver classes were never written by another, and the seam was silent for months. A new `LinearPriceUnitType` (`DriverClass = 'Linear'`) reads both columns off its own row, so a linear billing unit — "Per 1,000 Characters" — now ships as one seeded row with no class, no registration and no build. `DriverClass` remains the escape hatch for genuinely non-linear pricing (tiered rates, per-image-by-resolution, minimum-billing increments like the Groq 10-second floor). An _unregistered_ driver still refuses to price, deliberately: `DriverClass` is NOT NULL, so an unrecognised name is ambiguous between "a new linear unit" and "a non-linear driver whose code is missing", and pricing the second linearly would produce a confident wrong number.

  **`AIModelPriceType` is demoted alongside.** It was a NOT NULL FK that nothing prices, filters or branches on, while `AIModelPriceUnitType` carried the real contract — three vocabularies for one concept, with the _mandatory_ one the one nothing read. Adding a usage type without demoting it would have locked that ambiguity in permanently. Not dropped (NOT NULL, 235 metadata rows, and dropping is on the Forbidden list in `PUBLISH_NO_BREAK_POLICY.md`): the field is flagged `Status = 'Deprecated'`, removed from the generated form (`IncludeInGeneratedForm = 0`, which is the step that actually ends the ambiguity rather than documenting it), and has `AutoUpdateDescription` cleared so CodeGen cannot overwrite the demotion text — all declared in `metadata/entities`, where field-level editorial decisions belong, rather than as EntityField UPDATEs in a migration. The migration keeps only the schema half: a database default of `Tokens`, so new cost rows need not name a value from the vocabulary they are being told to ignore.

  **Prompt runs can record it.** `AIPromptRun` gains `InputUnitsUsed`, `OutputUnitsUsed` (both `CHECK >= 0`) and `UsageTypeID`, where NULL means token-billed — which is what every row written before the column existed IS, since the schema had no way to say anything else. That reading happens at exactly one seam (`MJAIPromptRunEntityServer.RecordedUsage`) rather than in four places, so the rest of the runtime still sees a definite measure. The save-time cost gate passes on units as well as tokens, and refuses — loudly — to price a run whose measure disagrees with its cost row's, rather than dividing seconds by a million and reporting the ~$0 that produces. No units rollup was added: units of different kinds cannot be summed, so cost remains the universal aggregate.

  **The catalog rows are declarative metadata, and that is what makes the new columns nullable.** The four measures live in `metadata/ai-usage-types`, and the measure + divisor for all six shipped billing units in `metadata/ai-model-price-unit-types` — seeded and backfilled by `mj sync push`, not by INSERT and UPDATE statements in the migration, so they are reviewable data in the same form as the rest of the catalog. Metadata is pushed by the release-time consolidated `*__Metadata_Sync.sql`, which by construction carries a later timestamp than any migration a PR can author, so a NOT NULL column defaulted to the Tokens row would fail the from-scratch build on the ADD itself: SQL Server materialises the default into every existing row and the foreign key has nothing to resolve. Nullable + FK is the strongest guarantee available before the seed exists — any non-null value is a real measure — and the runtime is written to that contract rather than around it: a price unit type with no measure refuses to price rather than guessing Tokens. Tightening both `UsageTypeID` columns to NOT NULL is a one-statement follow-up in the release _after_ the one that ships the seed.

  A clean-room bootstrap also found that `sp_updateextendedproperty` throws when the property does not already exist, so the demotion uses drop-then-add — the same fresh-install-only class as the `EntityField.Sequence` trap in `migrations/CLAUDE.md`.

  **`ModelUsageUnitKind` must stay a superset of the `AIUsageType` catalog, and the catalog rows are the source.** `MJAIPromptRunEntityServer` resolves a run's `UsageTypeID` to the catalog row's `Name` and hands that string straight to `ModelUsageUnitKind`. Nothing about that is checked by the compiler — the name arrives as a plain `string` from a database row — so seeding a usage type whose name the union does not carry produces no build error, just a runtime hole on exactly the rows using the new measure. `MODEL_USAGE_UNIT_KINDS` exists so a test can assert the two agree by reading the seed file rather than restating it. `Characters` is present for that reason and has no pricing driver yet, which is not a defect: the costing path refuses to price a measure no driver claims and logs why, which is strictly better than a plausible wrong number. A compile-time assignability pin backs this up (Vitest does not typecheck by default, which is how a narrowing slipped through once).

  **Providers.** Groq now requests `verbose_json` and reports the duration it was already being billed for, summed across split pieces. If any piece fails to report one, usage is left undefined rather than under-reported — a partial sum understates the bill while looking complete. `OpenAIAudioGenerator.SpeechToText` is implemented (it previously threw), with the same 25MB ceiling, the same injected `AudioSplitter`, and the same duration capture. The split-and-join loop moved onto `BaseAudioGenerator.TranscribeWithSplitting` so both providers share one implementation.

  **Cost rows now ship** for Groq Whisper Large v3 ($0.111/audio-hour) and Turbo ($0.04/audio-hour), verified against Groq's published pricing. `Whisper 1` is a **new** model rather than a vendor row on Whisper Large v3: OpenAI's endpoint serves the large-v2 checkpoint, and attaching it to the v3 record would misreport which weights transcribed a given run. It carries a $0.006/minute cost row.

  **Also:** the AC1 integration check flips from warning to hard assert now that every shipped unit type resolves — a future unit type added without a driver reddens the deterministic tier instead of scrolling past. The assert is scoped to unit types an **Active cost row actually references**, since those are the ones whose missing driver silently uncosts real runs; a custom unit type awaiting its driver, referenced by nothing, is reported rather than failed.

  A new **AC7** check is the monitoring counterpart to the whole refusal doctrine. Everything here turns a wrong number into a `NULL`, which is right — but a null plus a `LogError` in a server log is invisible, and that is precisely how B60 survived months with six dormant ACTIVE image cost rows. AC7 asks the question nothing asked: completed runs that did measurable work and carry no cost. It grades the two populations differently — no active cost row in the run's measure is a pricing-coverage gap and is reported; an active cost row in that measure _existing_ while the run is still uncosted means the pipeline had everything it needed and produced nothing, which is asserted.

  The two Explorer cost dashboards no longer carry their own copy of the divisor table. They now resolve a cost row's scale through its unit type's `DriverClass` against the exported `TOKEN_PRICE_UNIT_TYPE_DIVISORS`, and skip rows priced by a non-token unit type rather than defaulting them to the per-1M divisor — which had been dividing an hourly audio rate by a million. Both local tables were keyed by unit-type _display name_ using names (`Per Million Tokens`) that never matched the seeded ones (`Per 1M Tokens`), so every lookup missed and only the per-1M fallback made the numbers come out right; keying off the driver class removes both the miss and the fallback that hid it.

  Pricing also refuses, rather than reporting $0, when a run records continuous units without a resolvable usage type to name their measure — the same "we don't know what this cost" rule the rest of the path follows.

  Both transcription providers request `verbose_json` only for models that accept it. OpenAI's GPT-4o transcription models reject it outright, so they fall back to `json` and report no duration instead of failing the transcription; Groq's STT surface is Whisper-only today, so the guard there is prospective — matched on `includes('whisper')`, because `distil-whisper-large-v3-en` does support `verbose_json` and a `startsWith` test would strip its duration and leave every run through it uncosted. A reported duration of exactly `0` now leaves usage undefined rather than producing a measure with no quantity, which the pricing layer would refuse and log as a fault for genuinely silent audio.

  The PostgreSQL counterpart to the migration is deferred to the release build, per `migrations/CLAUDE.md`.

## 6.1.0-edge.2

### Minor Changes

- 48ff99f: Add `ModelConfiguration` — a per-modality, strongly-typed JSON configuration bag on the AI model catalog — at three levels forming an inherit-with-override cascade: `AIModelType` < `AIModel` < `AIModelVendor`, resolved base-first with per-key deep merge. One interface (`IAIModelConfiguration`: `LLM` / `Realtime` / `Vision` / `Audio` sections) is shared by all three levels via MJ's JSONType mechanism, so CodeGen emits typed `ModelConfigurationObject` accessors on all three entities. This generalizes the scalar cascade those tables already carry (`SupportsPrefill` / `PrefillFallbackText`): new session/call-time capability knobs now land as typed properties in one bag instead of a column per knob. Existing capability columns are untouched. `AIEngine.GetEffectiveModelConfiguration(modelID, modelVendorID)` is the single canonical read path; the pure `ParseModelConfiguration` / `ResolveEffectiveModelConfiguration` live in `@memberjunction/ai`.

  First consumer: realtime turn detection. `Realtime.TurnDetection` (`Mode: 'default' | 'serverVad' | 'semanticVad' | 'native'`, plus eagerness / threshold / silence tuning) flows catalog → session config bag → provider wire block on both realtime topologies, with precedence `profile default < ModelConfiguration cascade < realtime.session.turnDetection < runtime configOverridesJson`. Profiles declare `supportedTurnModes` and translate through the shared `MapNormalizedTurnDetection`; an unsupported mode is diagnostic-logged and falls back to the profile default, so a shared model catalog never rejects a session on any provider. Non-protocol drivers scrub the key. Turn detection was previously hardcoded per provider profile, so smarter models had no way to opt into their smarter turn modes.

  Fixes a latent bug: a live `Reconfigure` (the meeting-mode auto-response flip) hardcoded `server_vad`, silently downgrading any session running a non-server-VAD turn mode. It now rebuilds the session's actual resolved mode, with meeting-mode floor control composed on top.

  GPT Realtime 2.1 and 2.1-mini are seeded to `semanticVad` (eagerness `auto`) at the model level — the one behavior-affecting change here. Everything else is behavior-neutral while `ModelConfiguration` is `NULL`.

### Patch Changes

- ca4feb4: Workflow cost becomes a projection of the run tree, and a graph now runs in the order it was drawn.

  **Cost is the tree, not arithmetic beside it.** `AIAgentRun`'s four `…Rollup` columns are now written from `SumAgentRunTreeCost(LoadAgentRunTree(runID))` at settlement — one basis (per-node own spend), prompt-aware through `Configuration.runtime.promptRunID`, and structurally incapable of disagreeing with what the run viewer shows. The previous per-child loop filtered on `AgentRunID`, so every Prompt step's spend was absent, and mixed a descendant-inclusive number with an own-spend one. The tree now also carries the prompt/completion token split so all four columns share a basis. Writing the sum back makes the column an _output_ of the tree, which is non-circular only because the query reads own cost and never a rollup — stated in the query header and pinned by a test that plants an absurd rollup on a real run. When the tree cannot be summed (load failure, depth cap, graph not reachable), the columns are **cleared** rather than left holding a stale total from an earlier settlement.

  **A loop's passes exist.** The run tree reaches nested work through six relationships and a loop iteration was none of them, so a `While` that spent real money across three passes reported one childless node with no cost. The dispatcher now records one entry per pass (`ITaskStepRuntime.iterations`) and the tree expands them into nodes. On a real workflow this moved `TotalCostRollup` from `0.00049725` to `0.00555375` — the loop had been spent and not counted.

  **A graph is dispatched only once its edges exist.** Children and dependencies are now written in one transaction. Previously a poll could land between the two writes, see tasks with no prerequisites, and claim the whole graph at once — observed running a closing branch before the draft it was meant to judge existed, then reporting Complete.

  **Steps see their payload.** A step with no input mapping fell back to the raw input instead of the merged payload, so a Prompt step — which declares no mapping by design — rendered `{{ _CURRENT_PAYLOAD }}` as `{}` and wrote from an empty brief. Separately, a step with no output mapping _replaced_ the payload with its own output rather than merging; for a loop, whose output is a summary, that discarded everything the iterations had established and made a downstream `payload.x === true` edge unreachable.

  **An output mapping that names a parameter the step never returns now says so** (`unmapped`), naming what the step did return, instead of skipping in silence.

  **Human steps**: a cancelled request re-raises instead of stalling forever; cancelling a graph withdraws its open requests instead of leaving them in someone's inbox; cross-user `assignToUserID` is refused at submission rather than silently reassigned to the submitter; and a step can declare `expiresInHours`, which finally makes the existing expiry machinery reachable.

  **Web Search** captured each result with a non-greedy match that stopped at the first nested `</div>`, cutting the snippet out of every result — ten well-formed hits carrying no content. Results are now sliced between block starts, and an all-snippets-empty parse is reported rather than returned silently.

  **Testing**: a bundle whose every check is gated out now records an explicit skip naming the flag that would run it, instead of reporting PASS with zero checks executed.

### Minor Changes

- ef3e802: feat(prompt-config): scope-aware prompt run-settings override (ScopedPromptConfig + resolver)

  The run-settings sibling of `ScopedPromptPart`. Where `ScopedPromptPart` scope-overrides a
  prompt's TEXT, `ScopedPromptConfig` scope-overrides a prompt's RUN SETTINGS — model/vendor, AI
  configuration, sampling knobs (temperature/topP/topK/minP/penalties/seed/stopSequences),
  response format, and effort level — for an `AIPrompt`, narrowed by the SAME polymorphic scope the
  agent runtime already carries (`PrimaryScopeEntity`/`PrimaryScopeRecordID` + `SecondaryScopes`).
  Any MJ app can tune which model a prompt runs on and how it samples, per scope, by editing rows.
  - **Entity** `__mj.ScopedPromptConfig` — scope columns (mirroring `ScopedPromptPart`) + nullable
    override columns; `Status`/`Priority`. Whole-row-wins by specificity (SecondaryScopes match >
    PrimaryScopeRecord > global, tie-broken by `Priority`); each non-null column overrides the
    prompt default, a NULL column inherits it.
  - **`ScopedPromptConfigResolver`** (`@memberjunction/ai-agents`) — cached on `AIEngine`
    (`ScopedPromptConfigs`); pluggable via `@RegisterClass`; resolves the single most-specific
    in-scope config. `ApplyScopedPromptConfig` overlays it onto the run params
    (model/vendor → `override`, configuration → `configurationId`, effort → `effortLevel`, sampling
    knobs → `additionalParameters`).
  - **`BaseAgent` wiring** — `preparePromptParams` resolves + applies the config using the run's
    existing scope, right before the params are returned. **Runtime-explicit overrides still win.**
  - `StopSequences` overlays as a trimmed `string[]` (the comma-delimited column is split before it
    reaches `additionalParameters`, matching the runner's array contract — not the raw string).
  - Unit tests for the resolver (cascade / priority / status / null-column inherit / runtime-wins,
    plus the StopSequences-array and ResponseFormat mappings).
  - **`@memberjunction/ai-prompts`** — two `AIPromptRunner` fixes:
    1. **Response format override is honored** — the run now prefers `additionalParameters.responseFormat`
       (set by `ApplyScopedPromptConfig`) over the prompt's own `ResponseFormat`, keeping `'Any'`-means-
       silent semantics. Previously a `ScopedPromptConfig.ResponseFormat` was a no-op (the runner only
       read `prompt.ResponseFormat`).
    2. **`Messages` logging** — records caller-supplied `conversationMessages` to `AIPromptRun.Messages`
       even without a template-rendered system prompt (previously dropped for the
       `templateMessageRole='none'` path, leaving `Messages` null).

### Minor Changes

- 6125dcd: Skill activation governance & observability (v5.45): double activation gate (AISkill.ActivationMode × AIAgent.SkillActivationMode, both defaulting to RequestedOnly — self-activation requires Auto×Auto; /skill user requests unaffected) via new GetAutoActivatableSkillsForAgent; AIAgent.RequirePlanMode forces plan mode on every root run; AIAgentRun.PlanMode stamps plan-mode runs; plan-mode runs block skill activations after approval (re-plan required); AIAgentRunStep.Skills JSON records per-step AgentSkillInvocation provenance (activation type, gate values, agent-stated reason) on Skill/Prompt/Actions/Sub-Agent steps with native-grant precedence; agent-run UX gains a Plan Mode header chip, Skill/Plan step icons, per-step skill chips, and a Skills drill-in tab with provenance cards.

## 5.44.0

### Minor Changes

- 3633fbb: Agent Skills, Plan Mode, and realtime widget UX.

  **Agent Skills** — portable `SKILL.md` import/export, a first-class Skill step wired into the Loop agent runtime, Skills engine caching + agent-gating resolution, the `AI Skills` resource type with "Can Share Skills" authorization, and the AI Skill sharing panel in the entity forms. Includes the skill-markdown converter/operations and the generated entity + resolver surface for the new Skill entities.

  **Plan Mode** — a human-in-the-loop plan-approval gate for the Loop agent (server + client), threaded through the agent client session/types, the GraphQL AI client, and the conversations composer/message-input UI so a run can pause for plan review before executing.

  **Realtime voice widget UX** — fixes and consolidation in `@memberjunction/ng-conversations`:
  - Fixed `NG0100 ExpressionChangedAfterItHasBeenCheckedError` when opening the Details panel (defer the `ResizeObserver` seed + callback to a microtask).
  - The surface/Details panel is now an independent right-hand peek gated on available width (not console chrome / text-reveal), so opening Details keeps the glowing orb and toggling captions off no longer removes the panel; the orb also returns immediately on captions-off.
  - Type-to-compose: any printable keystroke opens the composer and seeds itself as the first character (removed the dedicated "T" hotkey + hint).
  - Control consolidation: the banner is now state + window-chrome only (removed duplicate Captions/End controls, folded "pure audio" into the gear's Density = Simple); Captions is promoted to a first-class control in the compact lean dock.

  **Remote Browser** — `RemoteBrowserSnapshot` now honors its documented best-effort contract: it returns an empty snapshot instead of throwing when the underlying browser adapter has been torn down, so the client's periodic live-view poll never surfaces a recurring GraphQL error (with unit coverage).

- 1367fbb: AI Skill permissions (full agent parity) + `/skill` composer invocation. Skills now use the same dedicated-table, **open-by-default** permission model as AI Agents via `MJ: AI Skill Permissions`: a cached runtime helper (`AISkillPermissionHelper`, open-by-default) and a unified-engine provider (`AISkillPermissionProvider`, closed-by-default / Sharing Center), grantee-exclusivity enforced by `MJAISkillPermissionEntityServer`, and a `GetSkillsForAgent(agent, user?)` filter so the model's skill catalog is intersected with the acting user's Run permission. The old `AI Skills` Resource-Type sharing is retired in favor of a skill-scoped permissions grid (`SkillPermissionsPanel`/`Dialog`/`Service`), with the `Can Share Skills` authorization repointed to it. End users invoke a skill for a message by typing `/skill-name` in the conversation composer (mirrors `@agent`/`#entity`; picker filtered by permission, chips use `AISkill.IconClass`/`Color`); selected IDs thread through the client → resolver → runtime chain as `ExecuteAgentParams.requestedSkillIDs` (both the `RunAIAgent` and `RunAIAgentFromConversationDetail` mutations), and `BaseAgent.preActivateRequestedSkills` activates them at run start only if they survive the guard (agent-accepted ∩ user-permitted). Requires the companion Agent Skills migration + CodeGen.
- 2f926df: feat(prompt-parts): scope-aware, pluggable prompt construction (ScopedPromptPart + PromptComponentResolver)

  Adds a first-class, scope-aware prompt-construction primitive to MJ core. `ScopedPromptPart` is a
  small, named, role-tagged fragment of prompt text attached to an `AIPrompt` and optionally narrowed
  by the **same polymorphic scope the agent runtime already carries for memory** (`PrimaryScopeEntity`/
  `PrimaryScopeRecordID` + `SecondaryScopes`). Any MJ app can control LLM behavior per scope by editing
  rows, not code.
  - **Entity + controls:** `__mj.ScopedPromptPart` with `Name`, `Role`, `Sort`, `Text`, `Status`, the
    polymorphic scope columns, and the resolver controls `MergeBehavior` (`Override` | `Append`) and
    `Priority`. The inclusion rule is data-driven, not hardcoded.
  - **Resolution + assembly:** cached on `AIEngine` (`ScopedPromptParts`); resolved by
    `PromptComponentResolver` — a **template-method** class whose protected hooks (`getCandidates`,
    `isInScope`, `score`, `selectIncluded`, `order`) are the extension points. Within a part `Name`,
    the most-specific scope wins (`Override`) or all in-scope parts accumulate (`Append`); distinct
    names compose additively. Roles are preserved (System/User/Assistant) — assembled messages drive
    the model directly, not flattened.
  - **Pluggable:** the agent runtime obtains the resolver via
    `MJGlobal.ClassFactory.CreateInstance(PromptComponentResolver)`, so a downstream consumer can
    `@RegisterClass(PromptComponentResolver) class X extends PromptComponentResolver { … }` and override
    the protected hooks for custom inclusion/scope logic — **no core change required**.
  - **Agent wiring:** `BaseAgent` resolves + injects scoped parts (role-faithful) alongside memory/RAG,
    using the run's existing primary/secondary scopes.

  Verified by unit tests (`PromptComponentResolver`) and a full agent run demonstrating the scope cascade.

### Patch Changes

- 5396d90: Add permission-constrained engine loading to BaseEngine — pre-checks entity read permissions during Config() and skips all entity configs (all-or-nothing) when the user lacks access, preventing endless retry loops and console error flooding for org-scoped SaaS users. Engine getters now use GetConfigData() which throws a typed PermissionConstrainedError instead of silently returning empty arrays. Also fixes unsafe GetHighestPowerModel/GetHighestPowerLLM return types and resolves FK_AIAgentRunStep_ParentID race in fire-and-forget step saves.

## 5.41.0

### Minor Changes

- cd6c5f0: Realtime AI Agents wave 3: consolidated v5.41 migration (sessions, channels, co-agent schema) with the AIAgentCoAgent affinity registry replacing AIAgentPairedAgent — typed relationship vocabulary (CoAgent implemented; Peer/Delegate/Fallback/Reviewer/Observer reserved), type-level co-agent defaults as junction rows (removing the only FK cycle in core MJ), and the full code sweep (engine cache, resolver resolution chain, server-side invariants, client pairing reads, regenerated manifests). Realtime UX: progressive-disclosure voice console with persisted captions preference, user-owned composer and tabs toggles, audio-reactive visuals; whiteboard pages/multi-select and review-persistence fixes. Gemini Live triggering turns ride realtime text so widget clicks/typed input/narration speak immediately on native-audio models. CodeGen: single-winner IsNameField enforcement with eligibility guardrail fixes, SCC-based cycle diagnostics, and clean-database bootstrap robustness (conditional engine registry datasets).
- a5f5472: Remote Browser channel + new realtime voice providers + computer-use enrichment.
  - **Remote Browser channel** (`@memberjunction/remote-browser-*`): an in-house realtime channel where an agent drives a live, CDP-connected browser while it talks (sales demos, support walkthroughs, trainer agents). New `AIRemoteBrowserProvider` registry (migration V202606161000) with JSONType capability gating; a universal `remote-browser-base` (driver family + `RemoteBrowserEngineBase`), a shared `remote-browser-cdp` kit (one lossless action mapper + `CdpRemoteBrowserSession`), a `remote-browser-server` engine + `RemoteBrowserChannel` (control arbiter, control modes AgentOnly/ViewOnly/Collaborative vs strategies ComputerUse/NativeAI), and five thin backends (Self-Hosted Chrome, Browserbase, Steel, Browserless, Hyperbrowser).
  - **computer-use** enriched additively into a complete browser-I/O + perception engine: CSS-selector-aware actions, CDP screencast, MouseMove, accessibility-snapshot/QueryElement/GetVisibleText/GetTitle/WaitForLoadState — every consumer benefits, existing vision/coordinate path unchanged.
  - **New realtime model providers**: xAI Grok Voice (`@memberjunction/ai-xai`, OpenAI-Realtime-compatible) and Inworld (`@memberjunction/ai-inworld`), with vendor/model seeds.
  - **Console logging improvements** across `@memberjunction/ai-core-plus`, `ai-engine-base`, `ai-prompts`, `aiengine`, `cli`, `generic-database-provider`, `metadata-sync`, and the bootstrap/forms packages.

  - **NEW**: Add AgentRunner class to coordinate BaseAgent + ConductorAgent interactions
  - **NEW**: Add AgentFactory with `GetConductorAgent()` and `GetAgentRunner()` methods using MJGlobal
    class factory
  - **NEW**: Add comprehensive execution tracking with AIAgentRun and AIAgentRunStep entities
  - **NEW**: Support parallel and sequential action execution with proper ordering
  - **NEW**: Structured JSON response format for deterministic decision parsing
  - **NEW**: Database persistence for execution history and step tracking
  - **NEW**: Cancellation and progress monitoring support
  - **NEW**: Context compression for long conversations
  - **NEW**: Template rendering with data context

  This implements clean separation of concerns:
  - BaseAgent: Domain-specific execution only (~500 lines)
  - ConductorAgent: Orchestration decisions with structured responses
  - AgentRunner: Coordination layer providing unified user interface

  Includes comprehensive TypeScript typing and MemberJunction framework integration.
