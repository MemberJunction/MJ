# @memberjunction/ai-core-plus

## 5.42.0

### Minor Changes

- e7c2437: Goal-driven browser control — blend computer-use with the remote browser so a realtime agent (or human) sets a high-level goal ("log into this site and open the latest invoice") and computer-use plans + executes it, instead of issuing granular actions.
  - **`@memberjunction/remote-browser-base`**: `IRemoteBrowserSession.RunComputerUseGoal(goal, options)` + `RemoteBrowserGoalResult` / `RunComputerUseGoalOptions` (with `OnProgress`, `Signal`, `ContextUser`, and `AgentRunID`/`AgentRunStepID` for narration, barge-in, per-user execution, and run-step observability). The `ComputerUse` vs `NativeAI` strategy is resolved by the existing `resolveControlStrategy`.
  - **`@memberjunction/remote-browser-cdp`**: `CdpRemoteBrowserSession.RunComputerUseGoal` drives MJ computer-use against the session's **own** already-attached `PlaywrightBrowserAdapter` (the same instance/CDP connection the human watches — no second browser), behind an injectable `ComputerUseGoalRun` seam (`SetGoalEngineFactory`). **Model-blind credential injection**: a `Context` object's `{{label}}` tokens are substituted with real values in a _cloned_ action at the CDP boundary, so neither the realtime model nor the computer-use controller ever sees the value (the recorded/logged action stays templated).
  - **`@memberjunction/remote-browser-server`**: `RemoteBrowserEngine.AchieveGoal(agentSessionID, goal, opts)` + the pure, testable `dispatchRemoteBrowserGoal()` strategy switch. **Collaborative pause-on-takeover**: a granted human takeover (or session end) aborts the in-flight goal so the computer-use loop pauses cooperatively rather than racing the human on the shared browser.
  - **`@memberjunction/computer-use-engine`**: controller auto-selection now prefers the highest-power LLM that advertises **Image input** modality (vision-capable), falling back to the plain highest-power LLM so selection never hard-fails (`pickHighestPowerVisionLLM`). New `AgentRunStepTracker` nests a child `Prompt` step per controller/judge prompt under the goal's parent step (linking each prompt run via `TargetLogID`), with the per-prompt step writes **fire-and-forget** (queued, flushed once at goal end) so an N-iteration goal pays no synchronous DB round-trips on its hot loop.
  - **`@memberjunction/ai-core-plus`**: new shared, single-source-of-truth step machinery — `initAgentRunStep` / `finalizeAgentRunStep` (field-level create/finalize semantics) AND `AgentRunStepSaveQueue` (the fire-and-forget INSERT/chained-UPDATE/`IgnoreDirtyState`/flush orchestration), reused by both `BaseAgent` and the Computer Use tracker (no copy-paste).
  - **`@memberjunction/ai-agents`**: `BaseAgent` refactored to delegate step field population to the shared helpers AND its save orchestration to the shared `AgentRunStepSaveQueue` (behavior-preserving; full 1348-test suite green).
  - **`@memberjunction/server`**: `ExecuteRemoteBrowserGoal` GraphQL mutation **+ production binding** — `MJProgressComputerUseEngine` (MJ prompt-runner routing, vision-model auto-selection, media persistence, progress narration) is bound to the CDP goal-engine seam at startup via `BindRemoteBrowserGoalEngine`. **Run-step observability**: the resolver creates one parent "Browser goal" `Tool` step on the realtime co-agent run (`beginBrowserGoalStep`) and threads it down so the goal's prompt runs nest under it.
  - **`@memberjunction/ng-conversations`**: `browser_AchieveGoal` realtime tool + channel route to the goal mutation.

  77 new unit tests (cdp 22, remote-browser-server 7, computer-use-engine 15, ai-core-plus 16 step helpers + save-queue, @memberjunction/server 15 goal-engine glue, ai-agents 2 createStepEntity nesting/target/InputData paths) plus the full 1350-test ai-agents suite green after the behavior-preserving refactor. Credentials use MJ's model-blind context-variable injection. No migrations. Live browser + LLM validation is the only step deferred — see `plans/realtime/computer-use-remote-browser-blend.md`.

### Patch Changes

- 256ab06: Fix agent-run steps (and prompt runs) occasionally stuck at `Status='Running'` / `CompletedAt=NULL`.

  When a step finished fast enough that its fire-and-forget INSERT was still in flight, the in-memory
  finalize mutation (`Completed`) was reverted by the INSERT's post-save reload
  (`BaseEntity.finalizeSave` → `init()` + `SetMany(insertedRow)`), and the chained force-persisted UPDATE
  then wrote the stale `Running` row. Predominantly hit fast Actions, but any fast step (e.g. a
  quick/cached prompt) could be affected.

  The fire-and-forget save queue now applies finalize/`TargetLogID` mutations INSIDE the post-INSERT
  continuation (after the reload), so they survive: `AgentRunStepSaveQueue.QueueUpdate` gains an optional
  `applyMutation` callback, `finalizeAgentRunStep` gains a `completedAt` option for deterministic re-apply,
  and `BaseAgent.finalizeStepEntity` + the three `TargetLogID` callback sites re-assert their values
  post-INSERT. `AIPromptRunner.updatePromptRun` now awaits the initial INSERT before mutating the final
  state. This mirrors the already-correct `ActionEngine.finalizeActionLog` pattern (which has zero stuck
  rows). Adds regression tests covering the race and the legacy clobber.

  Also removes a per-chunk `console.log` in `RunAIAgentResolver`'s streaming callback (debug noise that
  became hot once single-model prompt streaming was enabled).

## 5.41.0

### Minor Changes

- a5f5472: Remote Browser channel + new realtime voice providers + computer-use enrichment.
  - **Remote Browser channel** (`@memberjunction/remote-browser-*`): an in-house realtime channel where an agent drives a live, CDP-connected browser while it talks (sales demos, support walkthroughs, trainer agents). New `AIRemoteBrowserProvider` registry (migration V202606161000) with JSONType capability gating; a universal `remote-browser-base` (driver family + `RemoteBrowserEngineBase`), a shared `remote-browser-cdp` kit (one lossless action mapper + `CdpRemoteBrowserSession`), a `remote-browser-server` engine + `RemoteBrowserChannel` (control arbiter, control modes AgentOnly/ViewOnly/Collaborative vs strategies ComputerUse/NativeAI), and five thin backends (Self-Hosted Chrome, Browserbase, Steel, Browserless, Hyperbrowser).
  - **computer-use** enriched additively into a complete browser-I/O + perception engine: CSS-selector-aware actions, CDP screencast, MouseMove, accessibility-snapshot/QueryElement/GetVisibleText/GetTitle/WaitForLoadState — every consumer benefits, existing vision/coordinate path unchanged.
  - **New realtime model providers**: xAI Grok Voice (`@memberjunction/ai-xai`, OpenAI-Realtime-compatible) and Inworld (`@memberjunction/ai-inworld`), with vendor/model seeds.
  - **Console logging improvements** across `@memberjunction/ai-core-plus`, `ai-engine-base`, `ai-prompts`, `aiengine`, `cli`, `generic-database-provider`, `metadata-sync`, and the bootstrap/forms packages.

- 4b3fb9d: Add Skip entity-form support: #entity mentions in conversations, interactive-form host wiring, and reusable form-field components

### Patch Changes

- cc604aa: Agent in-flight memory writes: agents can commit durable cross-run memories mid-run via the memoryWrites loop-response field, gated by AIAgent.AllowMemoryWrite (ON by default — opt out per agent). Writes land as immediately-injectable Provisional agent notes (new Status value, with AuthorType provenance) under framework-enforced guards (descriptive types only, scope clamp, exact-restatement dedupe with same-run supersede, per-run cap, TTL), inject with recency-wins precedence and per-note recorded dates, and are hardened or pruned by a new Memory Manager pass each cycle. Cross-run dedupe requires exact normalized restatement so corrections are never silently absorbed into a stale note; the loop-agent prompt instructs agents not to claim a memory was saved before its result message arrives.
- 15b743b: Real-Time AI Agents — Sessions, Channels & the Realtime Model (plans/ai-agent-sessions.md). Adds the AIAgentSession/AIAgentChannel/AIAgentSessionChannel schema (+ AgentSessionID on AIAgentRun/ConversationDetail, CloseReason on AIAgentSession); the BaseRealtimeModel server primitive with OpenAIRealtime + GeminiRealtime drivers (server-bridged StartSession and client-direct ephemeral-token CreateClientSession, optional SendContextNote/RequestSpokenUpdate interim updates); the new @memberjunction/ai-realtime-client package with the BaseRealtimeClient browser abstraction + OpenAI/Gemini client drivers resolved via ClassFactory by provider key; the Realtime agent type + Voice Co-Agent with RealtimeSessionRunner/RealtimeToolBroker, AgentMemoryContextBuilder extraction, server session lifecycle (SessionManager, SessionJanitor, start/close/heartbeat + client-direct resolvers with delegated-run progress streaming, AwaitingFeedback resume, co-agent observability runs, user-selectable realtime model); the full-panel realtime voice call UX in ng-conversations (phone trigger + agent/model picker, banner/thread/activity rail, delegation working/result cards with provenance, ephemeral paced first-person progress narration driven by DB prompt templates, in-call text composer); Realtime Voice admin (AI Analytics dashboard sections, session/channel custom forms, agent Runs|Sessions execution history); and Query Builder/Strategist reliability fixes (entity catalog in prompt, Get Entity Details sample caps + semantic fallback, plan formatting). Also: the standalone @memberjunction/ng-whiteboard package (collaborative board with agent tool API, sandboxed interactive widgets + input bridge, markdown panels, exports, cancelable before/after events); ElevenLabs Agents + AssemblyAI Voice Agent realtime provider pairs (4-provider matrix, zero contract changes); session review mode with multi-leg resume carryover (timeline dividers, artifact junction closure, prior-transcript model hydration); delegation cancel channel; usage telemetry relay; Realtime Co-Agent rename with run-step/prompt-run observability.

### Patch Changes

- 6b6c321: Agent latency optimizations and parallel sub-agent execution:
  - **Embedding cache** (`AIEngine.EmbedText`): Replaced unbounded `Map` + FIFO eviction with `MJLruCache` (5000-entry LRU). Cache key now `${modelId}|sha256(text)` so a large text doesn't pin its full string. Cache stores in-flight `Promise<EmbedTextResult>` so concurrent callers share one ONNX inference instead of racing. Failed/empty-vector results evict on settle. Empty/whitespace text short-circuits to `null` without invoking the provider. Options `{ bypassCache: true }` / `{ noCache: true }` and `ClearEmbeddingCache()` exposed.
  - **AgentDataPreloader**: Data-source preload now runs with a bounded concurrency cap (default 10) via a new `resolveDataSources` helper so a long source list can't saturate the DB pool.
  - **Non-blocking step saves**: New `queueStepSave` chains saves on the same step ID (UPDATE can't race INSERT) while letting saves on different steps run concurrently. Failures are logged via `LogError` with `LatestResult.CompleteMessage`. `finalizeAgentRun` drains pending saves via `Promise.allSettled` (not `Promise.all`, which swallowed failures after the first rejection), folds failure counts into `agentRun.ErrorMessage`, and clears both `_pendingSaves` and `_stepSavePromises` so reused instances don't leak settled promises.
  - **Parallel sub-agent execution**: Loop agents can now return a `subAgents` array on `nextStep` to fan out to multiple sub-agents at once. Bounded fan-out concurrency (default 5). Each sub-agent receives a deep-cloned input payload (structuredClone with JSON fallback) so siblings can't see each other's in-flight mutations. Delegation messages + progress events are pushed synchronously in source order before any await, so transcript order is deterministic regardless of completion order. Per-sub-agent step `PayloadAtEnd` records that sub-agent's own contribution (not the cumulative merged state) for audit visibility. Termination semantics: parent terminates only when a _successful_ sub-agent requested `terminateAfter: true`; failing sub-agents fall through to `Retry` so the parent can react. Aggregated `user` summary message appended to the parent conversation.
  - **Driver sub-class surface**: Promoted to `protected` for driver sub-classes (e.g. Skip) — the step lifecycle triad (`createStepEntity` / `finalizeStepEntity` / `queueStepSave`), hierarchy display helpers (`formatHierarchicalMessage`, `buildHierarchicalStep`), dispatch utilities (`mapWithConcurrency`, `resolveSubAgentByName`, `cloneSubAgentPayload`, `incrementExecutionCount`, `getExecutionCount`), and read-only state getters (`Depth`, `AgentHierarchy`, `ParentStepCounts`, `FileOutputs`).
  - **Loop agent prompt template** updated to advertise the new `subAgents` array variant alongside `subAgent`, with the parallel-fan-out and success-only-terminate semantics documented so LLMs emit the new shape correctly.

  Tests: `@memberjunction/ai-agents` 806 pass (was 799 — added 7), `@memberjunction/aiengine` 74 pass (was 70 — added 4).

Unregistered file types are rejected at upload time unless the agent opts into AcceptUnregisteredFiles. Adds wildecard MIME resolver. `mj artifacts reclassify` for legacy rows

## 5.34.1

### Patch Changes

- 5abf790: fix(ai-agents): preserve context class identity through action and data preload pipelines

  `ExecuteSingleAction` was spreading `params.context` into a plain object to stamp `AgentID`, which destroyed class instances (getters, methods, prototype chain). This broke downstream consumers like Skip's `SkipAgentContext` whose `skipAPIRequest` getter became `undefined` after spreading. Similarly, `preloadAgentData` was spreading `params.context` when merging preloaded data.

  Fixed by mutating properties directly onto the original context object instead of spreading. Also changed `InjectContextMemory` to use `agent.RerankerConfiguration` property instead of `agent.Get('RerankerConfiguration')`. Added JSDoc to `ExecuteAgentParams.context` documenting that `TContext` may be a class instance and must never be spread. Added 20 unit tests covering context identity preservation.

### Minor Changes

- 4729398: Runtime Actions — Phase 1 complete. Introduces `Action.Type='Runtime'`, a new action type where agents dynamically generate, test, and persist JavaScript actions that execute in MJ's isolated-vm sandbox with a permissioned bridge to metadata, views, queries, entity CRUD, other actions, agents, and AI prompts. Ships the v5.29.x migration (new `RuntimeActionConfiguration`, universal `MaxExecutionTimeMS`, and `CreatedByAgentID` columns on `Action`), the JSONType-authored config interface, the Zod validator with drift detection, the bidirectional IPC bridge in WorkerPool, the full `utilities.*` handler surface, the ActionSmith meta-agent with `Create Runtime Action` / `Test Runtime Action` helpers, Agent Manager wiring, the generic `Execute Agent` action, and Runtime-aware approval UI enhancements. Minor bumps across all touched packages because the schema migration + metadata records are coupled surface changes.

## 2.112.0

### Patch Changes

- ed74bb8: Add parallel execution support for ForEach loops in Agent framework

  ## New Features

  ### Parallel ForEach Execution
  - Added `executionMode` field to `ForEachOperation` interface ('sequential' | 'parallel')
  - Added `maxConcurrency` field to control batch size for parallel execution (default: 10)
  - Implemented batched parallel execution with sequential result application
  - Results collected in parallel then applied to payload in original order
  - Provides 5-10x performance improvement for I/O-bound operations

  ### Performance Improvements
  - Web scraping: 10x faster for independent URL fetching
  - Document processing: 10x faster for batch file operations
  - API calls: Dramatic speedup for independent requests
  - Maintains correctness through sequential payload updates

  ### Safety Features
  - Default executionMode is 'sequential' for backward compatibility
  - Parallel execution collects results concurrently but applies payload changes sequentially
  - Order preservation ensures output mapping works correctly
  - Error handling respects `continueOnError` flag

  ## Updated Documentation
  - Comprehensive guide in `guide-to-iterative-operations-in-agents.md`
  - Updated TypeScript interfaces with new fields
  - Added usage examples for both Flow and Loop agents
  - Max concurrency guidelines by operation type
  - Database migration to update Loop Agent Type system prompt

  ## Usage Example

  ```typescript
  // Loop Agent requesting parallel execution
  {
      "taskComplete": false,
      "message": "Fetching 50 search results",
      "nextStep": {
          "type": "ForEach",
          "forEach": {
              "collectionPath": "searchResults",
              "executionMode": "parallel",
              "maxConcurrency": 15,
              "action": {
                  "name": "Get Web Page Content",
                  "params": { "url": "result.url" }
              }
          }
      }
  }

### Patch Changes

- 4567af3: **Component Feedback System (Registry-Agnostic)**

  Implement comprehensive component feedback system that works across any component registry (Skip, MJ Central, etc.) with support for custom feedback handlers.
  - Add skip-component-feedback-panel component with sliding panel UI (444 lines CSS, 161 lines HTML, 274 lines TS)
  - Add star ratings (0-5 scale), comments, and component hierarchy visualization
  - Add FeedbackHandler interface for customizable feedback logic per registry
  - Add ComponentFeedbackParams and ComponentFeedbackResponse types with full parameter set
  - Add POST /api/v1/feedback endpoint to ComponentRegistryAPIServer
  - Add submitFeedback() method to ComponentRegistryClient SDK
  - Add SendComponentFeedback mutation to ComponentRegistryResolver (replaces AskSkipResolver implementation)
  - Use ComponentRegistryClient SDK with REGISTRY*URI_OVERRIDE*_ and REGISTRY*API_KEY*_ support
  - Update skip-artifact-viewer to use GraphQLComponentRegistryClient for feedback submission

  - Update dynamic-ui-component and linear-report with component hierarchy tracking
  - Pass conversationID and authenticated user email for contact resolution

  **React Runtime Debug Logging Enhancements**

  Restore debug logging with production guards for better debugging capabilities.
  - Restore 12 debug console.log statements throughout React runtime (prop-builder, component-hierarchy)
  - Wrap all debug logs with LogStatus/GetProductionStatus checks
  - Add comprehensive README.md documentation (95 lines) for debug configuration
  - Logs only execute when not in production mode
  - Update ReactDebugConfig with enhanced environment variable support

  **AI Prompt Error Handling Improvements**

  Replace hardcoded error truncation with configurable maxErrorLength parameter.
