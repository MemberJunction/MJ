## 6.2.0-edge.3

### Patch Changes

- 279b93e: Multi-agent rooms now take turns properly with full-duplex realtime models, and the Live Room doubles as an agent test bed.
  - **Model-side addressing.** `IAddressedMatcher` gains a model-judged implementation next to the name-matching one. Full-duplex sessions get two host tools, `i_am_addressed` and `yield_turn`, because neither vendor offers a native signal. `TurnAddressing` (`Auto` | `ModelSide` | `Regex`) is selectable per session; `Auto` uses the model's judgement when the model reports the new `FullDuplex` capability (GPT-Live, Gemini 3.8 Live with always-on proactive audio) and name matching otherwise.
  - **Floor discipline.** `MultiAgentRoomCoordinator` now grants hand-offs with a TTL (a third agent cannot jump in), keeps backchannels (short "mm-hm" acknowledgements) off the floor, lets a person's speech preempt the holder through the existing barge-in flush path while delegated work keeps running, and caps consecutive agent-to-agent turns (default 8, configurable). A new `FullDuplexTurnGate` enforces it on models that decide for themselves when to speak, so two agents never speak at once even if neither asks first.
  - **Test bed.** New `GetLiveKitRoomTurnState` query and typed `GraphQLLiveKitClient.GetRoomTurnState`; new `mj-livekit-turn-state` widget; the Live Room gets per-agent turn mode and addressing pickers, roster badges and a live Turns panel (floor holder, hand-offs, backchannels, loop cap, event feed) that also works for a person who joins an existing room.
  - **Tests.** A deterministic replay harness with twelve recorded room timelines asserts no overlapping agent speech, no run beyond the loop cap, humans always preempt and backchannels never take the floor.

  No schema, metadata or CodeGen changes. Live-model behaviour of the host tools is not yet verified; see the "Multi-agent rooms" section of `plans/realtime/bridges-and-widget/LIVE-CALL-CHECKLIST.md`.

- 4840fff: Phone calls now get the same agent as the browser path, survive a dropped model connection, and can transfer, send DTMF and hang up.
  - **One co-agent resolution for every host.** The MJServer resolver's chain (explicit, the target's `DefaultCoAgentID`, the type default, then the global Realtime Co-Agent) and its `CanRun` filter on delegation agents moved to `ResolveRealtimeCoAgentID` / `FilterAllowedAgentsByCanRun` in `@memberjunction/ai-agents`. Twilio, Vonage and RingCentral use them, and the dialled agent is now the TARGET voiced by the co-agent instead of being used as both.
  - **Caller identity extension point.** `BaseCallerIdentityResolver` (register under `TelephonyCallerIdentity`) lets a host say who an inbound caller is. MJ core knows nothing about contacts; the default treats every caller as anonymous, and the model is told the caller ID is unverified.
  - **Phone-aware agent.** The model is told it is on a phone call and gets `transfer_call`, `send_dtmf` and `end_call` tools, offered per the carrier's `CallTransfer` / `DTMF` features. A transfer destination goes through the same E.164 and allow/block-list policy as an outbound dial. Keypad presses from the caller reach the model as one note per burst.
  - **Transfers go to a configured directory only.** `telephony.transferTargets` (`{ name, number, description? }`) lists where the agent may transfer a call; the tool takes a name, never a number, so an unverified caller cannot get free forwarding to an arbitrary number. Entries are validated against the outbound policy at startup, and with none configured the tool is not offered.
  - **Barge-in follows the browser policy.** Talking over the agent drops queued progress narration but does not cancel delegated work; the new `cancel_pending_work` tool is the explicit cancel.
  - **Transfer and DTMF no longer end the call.** Twilio sends DTMF as in-band tones instead of replacing the TwiML, and a transferred or goodbyed call is handed to the carrier rather than hung up when the media stream stops. Vonage uses its DTMF API; RingCentral detaches without a BYE.
  - **Model-drop recovery.** A lost realtime model session is reopened once with the conversation so far; if that fails the caller hears a carrier-side message (Twilio `<Say>`, Vonage `talk`) and the call ends. No retry loop.
  - **Spoken progress.** Delegations narrate progress on bridged calls.
  - **Transcript in the call's own conversation**, attributed to the dialled agent, instead of a shared "Meeting Room" conversation.
  - **Cleanup.** `ReconcileOrphans` runs at startup and every 10 minutes; ended calls close their `MJ: AI Agent Sessions` row; live calls heartbeat it so the host janitor does not close a long call.
  - **`telephony.maxConcurrentCalls` (default 25).** Over the cap an inbound caller hears "all agents are busy" and an outbound request is refused with `at-capacity`. Set it at or below the realtime model plan's concurrent-session limit.
  - **RingCentral `HealthCheck`** reports unhealthy when SIP registration failed or has been pending past a minute, with the reason.
  - **Audio.** A stateful per-direction resampler with a low-pass filter replaces the stateless one, removing frame-edge clicks and aliasing when 24 kHz model audio is sent at 8 kHz.
  - **Fixes.** Inbound bridge rows are stamped `InboundRoute` / `Active` rather than `OnDemand` / `Passive`; the roster no longer swaps the agent's and the caller's numbers; and the Twilio signature URL is the public URL's origin plus the request path, so a public URL ending in `/graphql` no longer double-counts the path.

- 8db8973: Telephony safety hardening for the Twilio, Vonage and RingCentral bridges. Inbound calls now run as the user named by the new `telephony.inboundRunAsUserEmail` setting instead of falling back to the System/Owner user; with no usable user the call is rejected (polite TwiML/NCCO, or a declined SIP INVITE) and logged — **inbound calls stop working after upgrading until the setting is configured**. Carrier media websockets are authenticated with a per-call secret token (Twilio `<Parameter name="mjToken">`, Vonage `mj_token`); unknown, mismatched or duplicate sockets are refused and never replace a live one, and a Twilio socket that never authenticates is closed after 10 s. Every outbound `Place*Call` is gated by the caller's right to run the agent, a destination allow/block-prefix policy and a per-process hourly rate limit (`telephony.outbound`; the default block list covers premium-rate and Caribbean toll-fraud prefixes). Vonage outbound calls now carry a correlation id so their media socket can be matched (previously outbound Vonage calls had no audio). Twilio gains signature-verified `/status` and `/amd` callbacks and Vonage terminal `/event` handling so unanswered/failed calls end their session, plus configurable answering-machine handling (`onMachine`). The answer webhooks reply immediately and start the bridge session in the background, buffering early audio (bounded). Twilio audio buffered before the stream starts is re-addressed to the real `streamSid` and capped, and phone sessions are capped at `telephony.maxCallSeconds` (default 1800).

## 6.2.0-edge.1

### Patch Changes

- 80905a1: Rename public class members and exported functions to PascalCase, per MJ's naming convention,
  **without breaking a single consumer**.

  Every renamed symbol keeps its old name beside the new one as a `@deprecated` stub that forwards to
  it — a delegating method or function, a getter/setter pair for a property, and for Angular a
  readable accessor pair for an `@Input` and a second `@Output` sharing the same `EventEmitter`, so a
  template still binding the old name keeps receiving events. Old names still compile, still resolve,
  and still behave identically; the deprecation tag rides through to the published `.d.ts`, so editors
  point callers at the replacement. Where a package re-exports through an explicit `export { … }`
  list, the new name is added alongside the old, so the correct name is actually on the public surface
  rather than merely declared.

  The rename is deliberately refused wherever a mechanical stub would not be equivalent, because
  several of those shapes change a type contract while still compiling in the package that declares
  them:
  - an **optional** property or parameter property — TypeScript has no optional accessor, so a stub
    would promote `foo?` to a required member and break every object literal that omits it;
  - a class that is a **data shape** (no methods, or `@ObjectType`/`@InputType`) — object literals are
    assigned to it, and an accessor stub changes what they must supply;
  - a property whose **subclass redeclares it**, since TypeScript forbids a property overriding an
    accessor (TS2610);
  - a name whose PascalCase form is **already bound** in that file or class;
  - decorated members, `get`/`set` pairs behind a decorator, generators, destructured parameters,
    overload sets and abstract members.

  **One wire-visible consequence, for version skew only.** `BaseInfo.toJSON` walks `_`-prefixed
  backing fields and emits them through their public getter, preferring the PascalCase one. Renaming
  the 23 field aliases in `MJCore/src/generic` therefore changes what `AllMetadata` carries:
  `EntityInfo.spCreate` and friends now serialize as `SpCreate`. A same-version client is unaffected —
  `copyInitData` accepts a value through a settable accessor, so either spelling lands on the right
  field. An OLDER client against a newer server has no such path in its `copyInitData` and drops those
  fields silently. Same-version deployments, which is the supported configuration, see no change.

  Each package was verified against its own pre-change baseline rather than against zero, because
  several packages in this repo do not typecheck cleanly to begin with. Angular packages were verified
  with `ngc`, not `tsc`: a plain typecheck does not compile templates, and an earlier write-only
  `@Input` alias passed `tsc` while breaking six template reads.

## 5.42.0

### Patch Changes

- 4b9361b: Add native two-way SDK bindings for all realtime-bridge providers. Each provider package gains a native send-capable SDK binding (the adapter that drives bidirectional audio + host/call controls over a real platform SDK, behind an injectable native-module loader and tested against fake modules). Adds a `BridgeNativeSdkRegistry` (in ai-bridge-base) keyed by `DriverClass` so the engine auto-binds the correct native factory at `StartBridgeSession`, with a per-session `BindSdk` override for choosing a non-default binding (e.g. Zoom RTMS receive-only) or injecting a fake. This is the MJ-side adapter + wiring layer; the platform-specific native media client (e.g. Teams ACS media streaming) and the session-start harness are the remaining work.

## 5.41.0

### Minor Changes

- 8fd6f59: Realtime Bridges (Phase 0+1): new media-transport layer that connects the one realtime agent engine to external endpoints — meetings (Zoom/Teams/Slack/Meet/Webex/Discord) and telephony (Twilio/Vonage/RingCentral/VOIP). Adds the v5.42 schema (5 entities: AIBridgeProvider with a strongly-typed SupportedFeatures JSON column, AIBridgeAgentIdentity, AIBridgeProviderChannel, AIAgentSessionBridge, AIAgentSessionBridgeParticipant — the bridge is an attachment to the existing AIAgentSession, not a new session). New packages @memberjunction/ai-bridge-base (BaseRealtimeBridge media driver with capability gating, AIBridgeEngineBase cache, pure passive/active/hybrid TurnTakingPolicy) and @memberjunction/ai-bridge-server (AIBridgeEngine completing the deferred server-bridged transport seam — bridge media ↔ IRealtimeSession.SendInput/OnOutput — plus a LoopbackBridge, host affinity and janitor). Five server-side EntityServer validation invariants. Nothing is audio-specific (typed directional audio/video/screen tracks).
