## 6.2.0-edge.4

### Minor Changes

- 465c950: The LiveKit row in `MJ: AI Bridge Providers` no longer claims `ScreenOut`. The meeting bot shares no screen: its only video out is the agent's avatar, and the bridge drops `screen-out` frames. The row keeps on-demand join, audio in and out, cameras (`VideoIn`) and shared screens (`ScreenIn`) in, the avatar as video out (`VideoOut`) and per-participant diarization. Once `mj sync push` applies the row, Explorer's provider form shows Screen out off. A unit test checks the row in `metadata/` against these flags and drives the bridge with them. Minor because the row is metadata.

### Patch Changes

- 1da00cb: An agent can now watch a LiveKit meeting. Set `realtime.video.watchMeetings: true` in the voiced agent's `TypeConfiguration`. When its realtime model takes video (Gemini 3.8 Live), the agent's bot joins with the `mj.agentWatches` attribute, so the room offers each person the choice, and reads the camera or shared screen of the people who allow it: one source at a time, at the model's frame rate, as JPEG (cameras scaled to 640 px on the longer side, screens to 1280 px). When a source whose frames reached the model ends (the person withdraws, leaves, stops sharing or turns the camera off), the model is told "[The agent can no longer see: Ada's camera]". In every meeting the bot now unsubscribes from video it does not read. The frame-rate and scaling math moves to `@memberjunction/ai` (`RealtimeVideoFrameIntervalMs`, `ScaleRealtimeVideoFrame`, `InboundVideoRateOf`), and the Gemini driver declares its video rate from the model's profile.
- acf0f5b: `BridgeMediaFrame` gains optional `Width`, `Height` and `KeyFrame`, so a bridge frame can say how large its video is and whether a decoder can start at it. The LiveKit bridge fills them on the camera and screen frames it hands the engine (the encoded JPEG's size; every JPEG is a key frame). The engine fills them on the avatar pieces it sends a bridge: the size the stream's init segment gives its video track, and for a fragment with video, whether its first frame is a key frame. Consumers that don't read them behave as before, and every field stays optional.
- ad3f44f: The meeting bot's only video out is the agent's avatar. The native room client's `publishVideo` and `publishScreen` no-ops are removed, from `LiveKitRtcNodeRoomClient`, `LiveKitWorkerRoomClient`, the media worker protocol (`MediaWorkerCommand`) and session, and the `NativeRoomClient` interface; `ILiveKitRoomSdk` and `LiveKitNativeMeetingSdk` lose `publishVideoFrame` and `publishScreenFrame`, which only forwarded to them. `LiveKitBridge.SendMedia` sends `video/mp4` frames on `video-out` to the avatar publisher as before, and drops any other `video-out` frame and every `screen-out` frame, logging the first of each per session when the provider allows that track.
- 1c76559: Fixes the Meet "could not load the native LiveKit room module at '@memberjunction/ai-bridge-livekit-native'" failure: `@memberjunction/ai-bridge-livekit` now keeps a process-wide registry of native room modules (`RegisterNativeRoomModule`) that `DefaultNativeLoader` checks before falling back to `import()`, and `@memberjunction/livekit-room-server`, which declares the native wrapper, registers it at load (no dependency cycle). `LIVEKIT_NATIVE_MODULE` overrides still go through `import()`. The native room client's `onDisconnected` callback now receives the LiveKit disconnect reason. The handoff offer registry no longer logs "User not found in metadata and no contextUser" every 15 seconds: the server now supplies the system user lazily, and queries are skipped (in-memory expiry still runs) when no user is available.
- 08a4cfc: The meeting bot publishes an agent's avatar. Before an agent's meeting session opens, the room coordinator asks the native room module whether the bot can publish one (`describeAvatarVideo`: `@livekit/rtc-node` with video publishing, and ffmpeg 4.2 or later with the H.264 and AAC decoders, from `MJ_FFMPEG_PATH` or the `PATH`, probed once per thread); only then does the session ask for it (`RealtimeAvatarSettings.Delivery: 'room'`, threaded through the bridged session prep), and the Gemini driver grants it on an endpoint that renders avatars (VIDEO, the avatar at 2 Mbps), with the decision on `IRealtimeSession.AvatarStatus`. A granted bridged Gemini session sends the avatar's fragmented MP4 as typed frames through `IRealtimeSession.OnVideoFrame`, plays PCM only before a turn's first video, drops media from `interrupted` to that turn's `turnComplete`, and reports the avatar video it generated as `OutputTokenDetails.VideoSeconds` deltas through `OnUsage` (counted up to `generationComplete`). The engine sends the pieces on `video-out` with their MIME type; in a full-duplex multi-agent room each piece passes the floor gate by its audio's duration (`FullDuplexTurnGate.OnOutputDuration`). The LiveKit bridge routes `video/mp4` frames to the room client (`publishAvatarMedia`), which reads them with Core's fMP4 reader (`ReadFmp4Fragment`, `AvccToAnnexB`, `AdtsHeader`, and `Fmp4AudioSeconds` beside AV9's `Fmp4VideoSeconds`; `ReadFmp4Init` also reads a track's size, the trex sample size and flags, the H.264 parameter sets and the AAC config), decodes them in two long-lived ffmpeg child processes, queues the voice on the bot's audio track and shows each frame on a camera track (`agent-avatar`, LiveKit's default simulcast, published at the first frame) when the voice's playout reaches the frame's timestamp. A barge-in drops the queued frames and fences both decoders; the last frame stays on screen. A decoder that dies is restarted; three failures of one decoder within 60 s, or a refused camera track, take the avatar down: the track is unpublished, the bot sets `mj.agentAvatar` to `audio-only:<reason>` (agent bot tokens now carry `canUpdateOwnMetadata`), and the engine replaces the model session with an audio-only one (`StartBridgeSessionParams.RecoverRealtimeSessionWithoutAvatar`). The bot's join token carries `mj.agentAvatar` (`on`, or `audio-only:<reason>` with `decoder-missing` when the host has no usable ffmpeg); Core adds the attribute helpers and the reasons `decoder-missing`, `decoder-failed` and `publish-failed`, which `ParseRealtimeAvatarStatus` reads and `REALTIME_AVATAR_UNAVAILABLE_REASONS` lists (from the same table); the call and mobile notices word them "Audio only for {Agent}: the avatar couldn't be shown in this meeting". `GeminiEnterpriseRealtime` renders a bridged session's avatar the same way. With the media worker on, the pieces are transferred to the worker, a restarted worker gets the stream's init again, and one restarted after a take-down joins audio only. Integration check RD17 (the LiveKit provider allows video out, and the native module answers the avatar probe). The MJAPI image can install a pinned LGPL static ffmpeg (BtbN) checked against its sha256; it is off by default (`INSTALL_FFMPEG=false`, so meetings stay audio only): fill in the pin values and build with `--build-arg INSTALL_FFMPEG=true` to turn it on.
- 69bf67c: An agent that watches a LiveKit meeting now picks which camera or screen its model sees, instead of keeping the first one until it ends. A shared screen comes first (the most recent share). After that comes the camera of whoever leads LiveKit's active-speaker list, once they have led for 1.5 s, then the camera already in view, then the camera of whoever spoke last, then the first camera in the room. A camera stays in view for 4 s from its first frame before another camera replaces it. A shared screen, a withdrawn consent and an ended source never wait. The bot itself and other agents never count as speakers. Only the chosen source is subscribed and read: a switch drops the old one, then subscribes the new one. The model is told what it sees: "[You can now see: Ada's screen]" right before the first frame of each source new to its session, and "[You can no longer see: Bob's camera]" when a source it saw stops, including on a switch (the ended note used to read "[The agent can no longer see: …]"). The hold lengths can be overridden through the bridge's `Configuration` (`VideoSpeakerOnsetMs`, `VideoSpeakerHoldMs`). Room telemetry gains `sourceSwitches`, `switchesHeld`, `activeSpeakerUpdates` and `switchGapMsLast` / `switchGapMsMax`. The live check script gains a switch scenario (`VISION_SCENARIO=switch`).

  A browser call's video notes use the same second-person set. `VideoSourceArbiter` now says "[You can now see: Camera]" when what the model sees changes (it said "[The agent is now viewing: Camera]"), "[You can no longer see: Whiteboard (the user turned it off)]" when a source is turned off (it said "[The user turned off the agent's view of: Whiteboard]"), and "[You can now see: Whiteboard (turned back on)]" when it is turned back on (it said "[The agent can see Whiteboard again]"). The notes are sent at the same moments as before, and `FormatSwitchNote`, `FormatDisabledNote` and `FormatEnabledNote` still override them.

- ff58383: `@memberjunction/ai-bridge-livekit` no longer exports its own `IsAgentParticipantIdentity`, added earlier in this release: use the one in `@memberjunction/ai`, which the bridge calls. Nothing behaves differently.
- d2cb42e: The rule that tells an agent's bot from a person in a meeting room now lives in one place, `@memberjunction/ai`: `AgentParticipantIdentity(agentSessionId)` gives a bot its participant identity (`agent-<agent session id>`), and `IsAgentParticipantIdentity(identity)` reads one back (any identity starting with `agent-`, in any case). The LiveKit room coordinator mints the bot's identity with it; the LiveKit bridge, the bot's video watcher and the bridge engine read identities with it, where the engine had three inline copies of the check. `IsAgentParticipantIdentity` in `@memberjunction/ai-bridge-livekit` is deprecated and calls the shared one, and the package now depends on `@memberjunction/ai`. The engine's verbose first-frame log says what arrived: "The agent can SEE your camera." or "...your screen." for video (it said "The agent is HEARING you." for every track); the line for audio is unchanged. Nothing else behaves differently.
- 6b487b8: In a meeting, the note that tells the model it can no longer see a camera or screen now names the source as the model was told with its first frame. The bridge engine named it by the label the driver reported when the source ended, so after a person was renamed mid-meeting, or when the first frame was read before they had a name, the model read "[You can no longer see: …]" with a name it had never been given. The name for a camera or screen that has none of its own ("a participant's camera", "a participant's screen") now comes from `UnnamedVideoSourceLabel` in `@memberjunction/ai`, beside the video notes; the LiveKit bridge's `VideoSourceLabelOf` and the bridge engine each wrote it. The documentation of `BridgeVideoSourceEnd.SourceLabel` says it can differ from the name the model was given.

## 6.2.0-edge.1

### Patch Changes

- 80905a1: Rename public class members and exported functions to PascalCase, per MJ's naming convention,
  **without breaking a single consumer**.

  Every renamed symbol keeps its old name beside the new one as a `@deprecated` stub that forwards to
  it — a delegating method or function, a getter/setter pair for a property, and for Angular a
  readable accessor pair for an `@Input` and a second `@Output` sharing the same `EventEmitter`, so a
  template still binding the old name keeps receiving events. Old names still compile, still resolve,
  and still behave identically; the deprecation tag rides through to the published `.d.ts`, so editors
  point callers at the replacement. Where a package re-exports through an explicit `export { … }`
  list, the new name is added alongside the old, so the correct name is actually on the public surface
  rather than merely declared.

  The rename is deliberately refused wherever a mechanical stub would not be equivalent, because
  several of those shapes change a type contract while still compiling in the package that declares
  them:
  - an **optional** property or parameter property — TypeScript has no optional accessor, so a stub
    would promote `foo?` to a required member and break every object literal that omits it;
  - a class that is a **data shape** (no methods, or `@ObjectType`/`@InputType`) — object literals are
    assigned to it, and an accessor stub changes what they must supply;
  - a property whose **subclass redeclares it**, since TypeScript forbids a property overriding an
    accessor (TS2610);
  - a name whose PascalCase form is **already bound** in that file or class;
  - decorated members, `get`/`set` pairs behind a decorator, generators, destructured parameters,
    overload sets and abstract members.

  **One wire-visible consequence, for version skew only.** `BaseInfo.toJSON` walks `_`-prefixed
  backing fields and emits them through their public getter, preferring the PascalCase one. Renaming
  the 23 field aliases in `MJCore/src/generic` therefore changes what `AllMetadata` carries:
  `EntityInfo.spCreate` and friends now serialize as `SpCreate`. A same-version client is unaffected —
  `copyInitData` accepts a value through a settable accessor, so either spelling lands on the right
  field. An OLDER client against a newer server has no such path in its `copyInitData` and drops those
  fields silently. Same-version deployments, which is the supported configuration, see no change.

  Each package was verified against its own pre-change baseline rather than against zero, because
  several packages in this repo do not typecheck cleanly to begin with. Angular packages were verified
  with `ngc`, not `tsc`: a plain typecheck does not compile templates, and an earlier write-only
  `@Input` alias passed `tsc` while breaking six template reads.

## 5.42.0

### Patch Changes

- 8c896c4: Docs: point the LiveKit provider README at the now-shipped `@memberjunction/ai-bridge-livekit-native` room client (the `@livekit/rtc-node` wrapper) and note the `NativeModuleSpecifier` / `LIVEKIT_NATIVE_MODULE` deployment knob.
- 4b9361b: Add native two-way SDK bindings for all realtime-bridge providers. Each provider package gains a native send-capable SDK binding (the adapter that drives bidirectional audio + host/call controls over a real platform SDK, behind an injectable native-module loader and tested against fake modules). Adds a `BridgeNativeSdkRegistry` (in ai-bridge-base) keyed by `DriverClass` so the engine auto-binds the correct native factory at `StartBridgeSession`, with a per-session `BindSdk` override for choosing a non-default binding (e.g. Zoom RTMS receive-only) or injecting a fake. This is the MJ-side adapter + wiring layer; the platform-specific native media client (e.g. Teams ACS media streaming) and the session-start harness are the remaining work.
