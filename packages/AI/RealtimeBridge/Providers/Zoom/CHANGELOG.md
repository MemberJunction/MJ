## 5.42.0

### Patch Changes

- 4b9361b: Add native two-way SDK bindings for all realtime-bridge providers. Each provider package gains a native send-capable SDK binding (the adapter that drives bidirectional audio + host/call controls over a real platform SDK, behind an injectable native-module loader and tested against fake modules). Adds a `BridgeNativeSdkRegistry` (in ai-bridge-base) keyed by `DriverClass` so the engine auto-binds the correct native factory at `StartBridgeSession`, with a per-session `BindSdk` override for choosing a non-default binding (e.g. Zoom RTMS receive-only) or injecting a fake. This is the MJ-side adapter + wiring layer; the platform-specific native media client (e.g. Teams ACS media streaming) and the session-start harness are the remaining work.

### Minor Changes

- a5f5472: Remote Browser channel + new realtime voice providers + computer-use enrichment.
  - **Remote Browser channel** (`@memberjunction/remote-browser-*`): an in-house realtime channel where an agent drives a live, CDP-connected browser while it talks (sales demos, support walkthroughs, trainer agents). New `AIRemoteBrowserProvider` registry (migration V202606161000) with JSONType capability gating; a universal `remote-browser-base` (driver family + `RemoteBrowserEngineBase`), a shared `remote-browser-cdp` kit (one lossless action mapper + `CdpRemoteBrowserSession`), a `remote-browser-server` engine + `RemoteBrowserChannel` (control arbiter, control modes AgentOnly/ViewOnly/Collaborative vs strategies ComputerUse/NativeAI), and five thin backends (Self-Hosted Chrome, Browserbase, Steel, Browserless, Hyperbrowser).
  - **computer-use** enriched additively into a complete browser-I/O + perception engine: CSS-selector-aware actions, CDP screencast, MouseMove, accessibility-snapshot/QueryElement/GetVisibleText/GetTitle/WaitForLoadState — every consumer benefits, existing vision/coordinate path unchanged.
  - **New realtime model providers**: xAI Grok Voice (`@memberjunction/ai-xai`, OpenAI-Realtime-compatible) and Inworld (`@memberjunction/ai-inworld`), with vendor/model seeds.
  - **Console logging improvements** across `@memberjunction/ai-core-plus`, `ai-engine-base`, `ai-prompts`, `aiengine`, `cli`, `generic-database-provider`, `metadata-sync`, and the bootstrap/forms packages.
