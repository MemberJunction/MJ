### Minor Changes

- 48ff99f: Add `ModelConfiguration` — a per-modality, strongly-typed JSON configuration bag on the AI model catalog — at three levels forming an inherit-with-override cascade: `AIModelType` < `AIModel` < `AIModelVendor`, resolved base-first with per-key deep merge. One interface (`IAIModelConfiguration`: `LLM` / `Realtime` / `Vision` / `Audio` sections) is shared by all three levels via MJ's JSONType mechanism, so CodeGen emits typed `ModelConfigurationObject` accessors on all three entities. This generalizes the scalar cascade those tables already carry (`SupportsPrefill` / `PrefillFallbackText`): new session/call-time capability knobs now land as typed properties in one bag instead of a column per knob. Existing capability columns are untouched. `AIEngine.GetEffectiveModelConfiguration(modelID, modelVendorID)` is the single canonical read path; the pure `ParseModelConfiguration` / `ResolveEffectiveModelConfiguration` live in `@memberjunction/ai`.

  First consumer: realtime turn detection. `Realtime.TurnDetection` (`Mode: 'default' | 'serverVad' | 'semanticVad' | 'native'`, plus eagerness / threshold / silence tuning) flows catalog → session config bag → provider wire block on both realtime topologies, with precedence `profile default < ModelConfiguration cascade < realtime.session.turnDetection < runtime configOverridesJson`. Profiles declare `supportedTurnModes` and translate through the shared `MapNormalizedTurnDetection`; an unsupported mode is diagnostic-logged and falls back to the profile default, so a shared model catalog never rejects a session on any provider. Non-protocol drivers scrub the key. Turn detection was previously hardcoded per provider profile, so smarter models had no way to opt into their smarter turn modes.

  Fixes a latent bug: a live `Reconfigure` (the meeting-mode auto-response flip) hardcoded `server_vad`, silently downgrading any session running a non-server-VAD turn mode. It now rebuilds the session's actual resolved mode, with meeting-mode floor control composed on top.

  GPT Realtime 2.1 and 2.1-mini are seeded to `semanticVad` (eagerness `auto`) at the model level — the one behavior-affecting change here. Everything else is behavior-neutral while `ModelConfiguration` is `NULL`.

### Minor Changes

- 9e2278c: Consolidate the OpenAI-protocol realtime driver family (server AND client) onto shared, subclassable implementations, and wire MJ's normalized effort levels through to the realtime session.

  **Normalized effort mapping (`@memberjunction/ai-openai`)** — the session Config bag now accepts MJ's normalized `effortLevel` (the `ChatParams.effortLevel` vocabulary: numeric 1–100 or named level), translated to provider literals through a new per-provider `OpenAIRealtimeProfile.mapEffortLevel` seam (OpenAI implementation exported as `MapEffortLevelToOpenAIRealtime`, quintile mapping across the five GA levels). Provider-native `reasoningEffort` remains an explicit override. Providers whose endpoints use different level vocabularies override the profile function — no protocol code changes. Also: `extractRealtimeFeatures` → `ExtractRealtimeFeatures` (PascalCase for exported functions), per-session `inputTranscriptionModel` override, and unconditional scrubbing of MJ-side transport keys (`endpoint`/`sampleRate`/`proxyBaseUrl`) so they never leak into a provider payload.

  **HuggingFace server driver subclasses the shared driver (`@memberjunction/ai-huggingface`)** — `HuggingFaceRealtime`/`HuggingFaceRealtimeSession` now extend the OpenAI driver via a profile plus the new exported `RawRealtimeWebSocketConnection` adapter (raw WS speaking OpenAI frames → `IOpenAIRealtimeConnection`; send-buffering until open, provider-error-frame rerouting, close shim — reusable by any future OpenAI-frame provider). The ~340-line protocol clone is deleted while every HF-specific behavior is preserved: ready-after-config `StartSession` (via the base session's new `WaitForConfigApplied` gate), fold-context-into-prompt, beta event aliases, tool-set fingerprint no-op, native-STT (no default transcription block), proxy-ticket client-direct topology, and compat `responseActive` robustness.

  **Client-side mirror (`@memberjunction/ai-realtime-client`)** — new shared layers: `OpenAIProtocolRealtimeClient` (the transport-agnostic protocol brain: event dispatch incl. GA+beta names, response state machine, narration tagging, tool-result queueing, the outbound actions) and `OpenAIProtocolWebSocketRealtimeClient` (websocket + client-owned PCM plane). `OpenAIRealtimeClient` retains only its WebRTC transport; `xAIRealtimeClient` and `HuggingFaceRealtimeClient` collapse to thin subclasses (Grok: model-on-URL + subprotocol auth + fixed 24 kHz + streamed-transcript collapse + wire diagnostics; HF: proxy-URL connect + `{session, sampleRate}` pact parsing + `session.created` gate + benign close semantics). The per-driver duplicate frame-model types are REMOVED (breaking for anyone importing e.g. `XAIRealtimeEvent`/`OAIResponseAudioTranscriptDelta`/`IxAIClientSocket` from the driver modules — import the `OAIProtocol*`/`OpenAIProtocol*`/`IOpenAIProtocolClientSocket` names from the package root instead; repo-wide search found no consumers outside this package's own tests). Guard improvement: `RequestSpokenUpdate` on a non-open transport no longer flags busy without sending.

  **Testing** — dramatically expanded across the family: new `RawRealtimeWebSocketConnection` suite (buffering, dual error channel, listener semantics, payload integrity), `WaitForConfigApplied` lifecycle coverage, config-extraction hardening, per-provider gating proofs, and a ~2.7× expansion of the HuggingFace client suite (pact edges, tool loop, narration, barge-in/cancel, transport semantics, teardown). Suite totals: ai-openai 120, ai-xai 50, ai-huggingface 30, ai-realtime-client 377 — all passing; the pre-existing suites pass unchanged against the subclassed drivers (behavior-preserving refactor).

### Patch Changes

- bc388e3: Realtime QA hardening — every finding from the adversarial audit of the driver-family consolidation (PR #3177) plus the broader co-agent architecture, fixed with regression tests (plan: `plans/complete/realtime-qa-hardening.md`).

  **Regression fixes (A-items)** — bodyless provider `error` frames are recoverable again on raw-WS providers (adapter synthesizes the payload; transport failures stay fatal); `Capabilities.CanReconfigureTurnMode` is profile-gated (`supportsLiveReconfigure` — HuggingFace now truthfully reports false and `Reconfigure` no-ops); protected wire fields (`type`/`instructions`/`tools`) can no longer be overridden through the open Config bag (closing a strict-endpoint session.update kill vector) while the documented `audio` override remains; the client-direct minted `SessionConfig` now applies the residual bag with the same construction order as server-bridged (the two topologies are actually identical); deferred-config listener cleanup on early teardown; family-wide empty-transcript suppression; settle-handle + adapter buffer hygiene.

  **Robustness (B-items)** — connect/readiness deadlines everywhere (client WS `connectTimeoutMs` covering open + `session.created`, with socket-death/`Disconnect` releasing the awaited `Connect`; server `configReadinessTimeoutMs` rejecting `WaitForConfigApplied` on silent endpoints without cancelling the deferred apply); stale-`response.done` protection (a cancelled turn's trailing done can't release the busy lock under a locally-initiated replacement); TRUE-barge-in drops queued tool-result auto-triggers (the model never speaks over a user who took the floor; delivery via the user's next turn); WebRTC remote-stream handlers cleared on Disconnect; WS sends gated on socket-open.

  **Architecture (C-items)** — `realtime.session` tuning config (`effortLevel`/`parallelToolCalls`/`mcpTools`/`inputTranscriptionModel`) now flows config→bag→driver on BOTH topologies (`GetSessionTuningSettings`; the PR #3177 driver features are live end-to-end); per-modality usage detail (`RealtimeUsage.Input/OutputTokenDetails`) captured by the OpenAI driver, accumulated by the runner, and persisted on the realtime `AIPromptRun` for multi-channel cost attribution; HF proxy hardening (optional `MJ_REALTIME_PROXY_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` allowlist, upstream-open deadline, bounded pre-open buffer); the session runner observes the chained cancellation signal and performs bounded transport reconnects (default 1, `MaxTransportReconnects`); MCP approval requests are auto-DENIED so the turn continues instead of dead-air blocking; Gemini scrubs+warns on foreign OpenAI-protocol/transport keys (`REALTIME_SHARED_CONFIG_KEYS` exported from Core); `RealtimeTranscript.ReplacesPrevious` added for streamed-final providers.

  Suite totals after the wave: ai-openai 147, ai-realtime-client 391, ai-agents 1653, ai-gemini 87, ai-xai 50, ai-huggingface 34, MJServer proxy 8 — all passing.

  **Second-pass re-audit fixes**: a follow-up adversarial audit of the hardening itself found the C1 fix was inert (the new realtime.session field was never propagated through the effective-config resolver — now fixed with normalizeSession), plus untested edges introduced by the B2 counter (permanent wedge on a rejected response.create — now self-heals on the error frame), the C7 reconnect (abort/Stop race leaking a live session; stale call_id relayed to the fresh session; no re-entrancy/identity guard — all fixed), the client connect deadline (timer leak on synchronous socket-construction throw), reused-instance socket handling (old socket late close corrupting the new session), the C4 abort window (abort during StartSession lost), model not being a protected wire field, and ReplacesPrevious being ignored at the transcript-persist site. All fixed with regression + interaction-seam tests.

  **Fifth-pass re-audit fixes**: a five-reviewer verification pass found one reachable correctness bug and closed two latent transcript fragilities. (1) The pass-4 client `onErrorFrame` fix cleared the pending narration kind only when no confirmed response was active, so a narration create rejected while a cancelled response drained mistagged the next delegated-answer turn as ephemeral (dropping its transcript) — the kind is now cleared unconditionally on the rejecting error. (2) The transcript in-flight-row bookkeeping moved to an `{id, open}` model so a turn that emits both an interim delta and repeated streamed completeds still collapses to one row, and a short assistant final no longer suppresses the next turn's interim streaming row. Coverage added for the `confirmedResponseActive` busy-lock guard and the per-turn `ReplacesPrevious` reset (xAI + HuggingFace).

  **Fourth-pass re-audit fixes**: a four-reviewer pass found one regression from the third-pass work and several reachable pre-existing defects, all fixed with regression tests. (1) The third-pass usage un-gate let a trailing usage frame accumulate after `Stop()` and arm a post-finalize checkpoint timer — now gated on the runner lifecycle (`!stopped`) instead. (2) `RealtimeTranscript.ReplacesPrevious` is now wired END-TO-END: the shared server session flags the 2nd+ streamed user transcription completed (Grok streams repeated growing finals) and `persistRealtimeTranscript` uses status-disambiguated reuse, so server-bridged Grok/ElevenLabs no longer mint a duplicate `ConversationDetail` per caption (previously the flag was only ever set client-side). (3) The client `onErrorFrame` self-heal now clears the eager `responseActive`/narration phantom left by a rejected local `response.create` (a `confirmedResponseActive` flag distinguishes it from a live VAD turn) so `IsBusy` no longer wedges on compat endpoints. (4) The tool broker aborts EVERY concurrent delegation on barge-in (was: only the newest, orphaning the rest). (5) The HuggingFace server session declares its native 16 kHz sample rate (was: bridge fell back to 24 kHz into a 16 kHz pipeline). (6) A stuck delegate can no longer leak stale narration-burst timing across a reconnect (burst state reset decoupled from the delegation counter).

  **Third-pass re-audit fixes**: a third adversarial pass against the latest `next` found three residual seams: (1) the C8 transcript-persist fix only bound the in-flight key on the INTERIM branch, so a FINALS-ONLY streamed provider (e.g. Grok user captions, ElevenLabs corrections) that never emits an interim delta still minted a duplicate `ConversationDetail` row per correction — the create+finalize branch now binds the key too; (2) the C7 reconnect blanket-zeroed the runner's shared `activeDelegations` counter, which — combined with each aborted delegation's self-decrementing `finally` — could double-decrement and steal a CONCURRENT post-reconnect delegation's narration burst; the reset is gone (frames self-unwind); (3) `OnUsage` was identity-gated like every other handler, so a trailing usage frame flushed on the just-dropped socket was silently discarded — usage is runner-GLOBAL (cumulative) and is now un-gated. Plus a bounded-worst-case characterization test for the S1 self-heal. All fixed with regression + interaction-seam tests.

## 5.48.0

### Minor Changes

- c20723a: Add a self-hosted **HuggingFace speech-to-speech** realtime (voice) provider, sitting side-by-side with the cloud realtime providers (OpenAI, Gemini, ElevenLabs, AssemblyAI) with no host changes. It treats HuggingFace's open-source VAD → STT → LLM → TTS stack (in its OpenAI-Realtime-compatible `/v1/realtime` mode) as a `Realtime` model — private-by-design (audio never leaves owned infrastructure), cost-free, and component-swappable.

  Because the endpoint is self-hosted, the shipped client-direct audio topology runs through a new provider-agnostic **MJAPI realtime proxy**: the driver mints a one-time ticket into a shared `RealtimeProxyRegistry` (`@memberjunction/ai`) and hands the browser a `wss://<mjapi-public>/realtime-proxy?ticket=…` URL, so the internal endpoint + auth never reach the browser and the box needs no browser-facing ingress. Adds the new `@memberjunction/ai-huggingface` driver package, the `HuggingFaceRealtimeClient` (`@memberjunction/ai-realtime-client`), the `RealtimeProxyServer` + single upgrade-router in `@memberjunction/server`, the class-registration manifest entry (`@memberjunction/server-bootstrap`), and the client-load wiring (`@memberjunction/ng-conversations`), plus the `Hugging Face` vendor + `HuggingFace Speech-to-Speech` model metadata (low PowerRank — opt-in). Additive only; endpoint/auth/sample-rate are deployment config.
