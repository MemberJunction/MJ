## 6.1.0-edge.2

### Minor Changes

- 5ecfdb4: Realtime voice agents can now **speak first**.

  Conversation-start behavior is not instruction-following: an ElevenLabs realtime agent with no `first_message` produces no audio at all until it receives user audio, whatever the persona prompt says. Every ElevenLabs realtime session therefore opened in silence, waiting for the human to guess they should talk (issue #3557).
  - **`ElevenLabsRealtime`** now sends an `agent.first_message` conversation-config override, built alongside the existing prompt and voice overrides, so both topologies (server-bridged and client-direct) carry it. The managed agent enables the override, and — because `OverridesSatisfied` requires it too — an agent provisioned by an earlier MJ version is re-PATCHed on next use instead of silently dropping it forever (the failure mode behind #3374). Omitting it preserves today's wait-for-the-user behavior exactly.
  - **New persona slot `realtime.voice.default.firstMessage`** authors the opening utterance without naming a vendor, filed onto whichever driver resolves under the neutral `firstMessage` key — the same shape as the agnostic `voice`. It reaches both realtime host paths (`BaseAgent` server-bridged and `RealtimeClientSessionService` client-direct). The text is spoken VERBATIM; it is the literal opening line, not guidance about how to open.
  - **`AssemblyAIRealtime`** honors the same neutral `firstMessage` key for its `greeting` wire slot. The legacy `greeting` config key still works; `firstMessage` wins when it carries something. Both go through the same trim-and-drop-blank rule as the ElevenLabs driver, so one authored value means the same thing whichever vendor runs — in particular a blank `firstMessage` reads as "none authored" and does not suppress a valid legacy `greeting`.
  - **`firstMessage` is registered in `REALTIME_SHARED_CONFIG_KEYS`**, and the drivers that do not consume it now scrub it. Because an agnostic persona slot is filed onto _whichever_ driver resolves, an unregistered neutral key survives each driver's residual-bag spread and reaches the provider as an unknown session field — it was reaching the OpenAI (and xAI) `session.update` payload on both topologies, and Inworld's raw-override loop was copying it onto the session verbatim. On the OpenAI-protocol endpoints a malformed session object is rejected wholesale, taking the prompt and tools with it. Inworld now scrubs the whole shared vocabulary, closing the same class of leak for the other shared keys too.

  Drivers without a provider-native opening utterance ignore the key and open silently, as before.

### Patch Changes

- 15b743b: Real-Time AI Agents — Sessions, Channels & the Realtime Model (plans/ai-agent-sessions.md). Adds the AIAgentSession/AIAgentChannel/AIAgentSessionChannel schema (+ AgentSessionID on AIAgentRun/ConversationDetail, CloseReason on AIAgentSession); the BaseRealtimeModel server primitive with OpenAIRealtime + GeminiRealtime drivers (server-bridged StartSession and client-direct ephemeral-token CreateClientSession, optional SendContextNote/RequestSpokenUpdate interim updates); the new @memberjunction/ai-realtime-client package with the BaseRealtimeClient browser abstraction + OpenAI/Gemini client drivers resolved via ClassFactory by provider key; the Realtime agent type + Voice Co-Agent with RealtimeSessionRunner/RealtimeToolBroker, AgentMemoryContextBuilder extraction, server session lifecycle (SessionManager, SessionJanitor, start/close/heartbeat + client-direct resolvers with delegated-run progress streaming, AwaitingFeedback resume, co-agent observability runs, user-selectable realtime model); the full-panel realtime voice call UX in ng-conversations (phone trigger + agent/model picker, banner/thread/activity rail, delegation working/result cards with provenance, ephemeral paced first-person progress narration driven by DB prompt templates, in-call text composer); Realtime Voice admin (AI Analytics dashboard sections, session/channel custom forms, agent Runs|Sessions execution history); and Query Builder/Strategist reliability fixes (entity catalog in prompt, Get Entity Details sample caps + semantic fallback, plan formatting). Also: the standalone @memberjunction/ng-whiteboard package (collaborative board with agent tool API, sandboxed interactive widgets + input bridge, markdown panels, exports, cancelable before/after events); ElevenLabs Agents + AssemblyAI Voice Agent realtime provider pairs (4-provider matrix, zero contract changes); session review mode with multi-leg resume carryover (timeline dividers, artifact junction closure, prior-transcript model hydration); delegation cancel channel; usage telemetry relay; Realtime Co-Agent rename with run-step/prompt-run observability.
