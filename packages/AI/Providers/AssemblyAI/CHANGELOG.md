Adds the AIAgentSession/AIAgentChannel/AIAgentSessionChannel schema (+ AgentSessionID on AIAgentRun/ConversationDetail, CloseReason on AIAgentSession); the BaseRealtimeModel server primitive with OpenAIRealtime + GeminiRealtime drivers (server-bridged StartSession and client-direct ephemeral-token CreateClientSession, optional SendContextNote/RequestSpokenUpdate interim updates); the new @memberjunction/ai-realtime-client package with the BaseRealtimeClient browser abstraction + OpenAI/Gemini client drivers resolved via ClassFactory by provider key; the Realtime agent type + Voice Co-Agent with RealtimeSessionRunner/RealtimeToolBroker, AgentMemoryContextBuilder extraction, server session lifecycle (SessionManager, SessionJanitor, start/close/heartbeat + client-direct resolvers with delegated-run progress streaming, AwaitingFeedback resume, co-agent observability runs, user-selectable realtime model); the full-panel realtime voice call UX in ng-conversations (phone trigger + agent/model picker, banner/thread/activity rail, delegation working/result cards with provenance, ephemeral paced first-person progress narration driven by DB prompt templates, in-call text composer); Realtime Voice admin (AI Analytics dashboard sections, session/channel custom forms, agent Runs|Sessions execution history); and Query Builder/Strategist reliability fixes (entity catalog in prompt, Get Entity Details sample caps + semantic fallback, plan formatting). Also: the standalone @memberjunction/ng-whiteboard package (collaborative board with agent tool API, sandboxed interactive widgets + input bridge, markdown panels, exports, cancelable before/after events); ElevenLabs Agents + AssemblyAI Voice Agent realtime provider pairs (4-provider matrix, zero contract changes); session review mode with multi-leg resume carryover (timeline dividers, artifact junction closure, prior-transcript model hydration); delegation cancel channel; usage telemetry relay; Realtime Co-Agent rename with run-step/prompt-run observability.
