### Patch Changes

- 80905a1: Rename public class members and exported functions to PascalCase, per MJ's naming convention,
  **without breaking a single consumer**.

  Every renamed symbol keeps its old name beside the new one as a `@deprecated` stub that forwards to
  it — a delegating method or function, a getter/setter pair for a property, and for Angular a
  readable accessor pair for an `@Input` and a second `@Output` sharing the same `EventEmitter`, so a
  template still binding the old name keeps receiving events. Old names still compile, still resolve,
  and still behave identically; the deprecation tag rides through to the published `.d.ts`, so editors
  point callers at the replacement. Where a package re-exports through an explicit `export { … }`
  list, the new name is added alongside the old, so the correct name is actually on the public surface
  rather than merely declared.

  The rename is deliberately refused wherever a mechanical stub would not be equivalent, because
  several of those shapes change a type contract while still compiling in the package that declares
  them:
  - an **optional** property or parameter property — TypeScript has no optional accessor, so a stub
    would promote `foo?` to a required member and break every object literal that omits it;
  - a class that is a **data shape** (no methods, or `@ObjectType`/`@InputType`) — object literals are
    assigned to it, and an accessor stub changes what they must supply;
  - a property whose **subclass redeclares it**, since TypeScript forbids a property overriding an
    accessor (TS2610);
  - a name whose PascalCase form is **already bound** in that file or class;
  - decorated members, `get`/`set` pairs behind a decorator, generators, destructured parameters,
    overload sets and abstract members.

  **One wire-visible consequence, for version skew only.** `BaseInfo.toJSON` walks `_`-prefixed
  backing fields and emits them through their public getter, preferring the PascalCase one. Renaming
  the 23 field aliases in `MJCore/src/generic` therefore changes what `AllMetadata` carries:
  `EntityInfo.spCreate` and friends now serialize as `SpCreate`. A same-version client is unaffected —
  `copyInitData` accepts a value through a settable accessor, so either spelling lands on the right
  field. An OLDER client against a newer server has no such path in its `copyInitData` and drops those
  fields silently. Same-version deployments, which is the supported configuration, see no change.

  Each package was verified against its own pre-change baseline rather than against zero, because
  several packages in this repo do not typecheck cleanly to begin with. Angular packages were verified
  with `ngc`, not `tsc`: a plain typecheck does not compile templates, and an earlier write-only
  `@Input` alias passed `tsc` while breaking six template reads.
