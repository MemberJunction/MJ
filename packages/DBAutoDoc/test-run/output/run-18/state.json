          "[Level 0] MEDIUM: Purchase_Order_Header - \"ship_amt\" is limited to either 150 or 0, which is unrealistic for varied shipping costs and conflicts with the more flexible shipping charge handling in the Order_Header and Shipment tables.",
          "[Level 0] MEDIUM: Order_Header - Shipping charge is stored as \"ship_amt\" with allowed values 0, 15, or 25, while the Purchase_Order_Header uses a fixed 150/0 and the Shipment table stores the actual cost, creating duplicated and inconsistent shipping cost data.",
          "[Level 0] LOW: Category_Lookup - \"lvl\" is defined only as 1 (top‑level) or 2 (sub‑category) despite the self‑referencing parent column allowing deeper hierarchies.",
          "[Level 0] MEDIUM: Receipt - \"whs_id\" is described as limited to values 1‑8, which may conflict with the Warehouse master table that could contain a broader set of identifiers.",
          "[Level 0] MEDIUM: Order_Line - Discount is stored as a monetary amount \"disc\" on each line, while the Order_Header stores a percentage \"disc_pct\" for the whole order, leading to inconsistent discount representation.",
          "[Level 0] LOW: Shipment - Shipment status codes include both \"D\" (Delivered) and \"S\" (Shipped), which can be confusing because both indicate that the shipment has left the warehouse.",
          "[Level 0] LOW: Payment - \"ord_id\" is nullable, but the description does not explain when a payment would not be linked to an order (e.g., pre‑payments, credit memos)."

Street lines (ln1, ln2), city (cty), state (st), zip, and country (ctry) are typical address fields. The 'dflt' bit marks the default address. Sample data (e.g., \"528 Park Boulevard\", city names, US state codes) confirms address semantics.
