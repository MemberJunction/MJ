          "[Level 0] HIGH: EmailTemplate - EmailTemplate is referenced by AssociationDemo.EmailSend, but EmailSend is not described, so the usage of templates in the system cannot be understood.",
          "[Level 0] HIGH: Chapter - Chapter is referenced by AssociationDemo.ChapterMembership and AssociationDemo.ChapterOfficer, yet those linking tables are absent, leaving the membership and officer relationships undefined.",
          "[Level 0] HIGH: Event - Event is referenced by AssociationDemo.EventRegistration and AssociationDemo.EventSession, but those tables are not described, so registration flow and session breakdown are unclear.",
          "[Level 0] HIGH: MembershipType - MembershipType is referenced by AssociationDemo.Membership, yet the Membership table (which would link members to a type) is missing, making the membership lifecycle ambiguous.",
          "[Level 0] HIGH: Organization - Organization is referenced by AssociationDemo.Member, but the Member table is not described, so the relationship between individuals and their employer organizations is unknown.",
          "[Level 0] MEDIUM: Segment - Segment is referenced by AssociationDemo.CampaignMember, but CampaignMember is missing, limiting understanding of how segments are applied to campaigns.",
          "[Level 1] MEDIUM: EventSession - SpeakerName is stored as free text instead of a foreign key to the Member table, preventing referential integrity and making it impossible to query speaker details consistently.",
          "[Level 1] LOW: EventSession - No foreign key or reference to session registrations, even though Member is referenced by EventRegistration; unclear how attendees are linked to specific sessions.",
          "[Level 2] HIGH: EventRegistration - The InvoiceID column references an invoice, yet the table’s Depends On list does not include the Invoice table, leaving the foreign‑key relationship undocumented.",
          "[Level 2] MEDIUM: Membership - The interaction between AutoRenew (boolean) and RenewalDate is unclear; the description does not state whether RenewalDate must be populated when AutoRenew is true, leading to ambiguous business rules.",
          "[Level 2] LOW: ChapterOfficer - EndDate is noted as null for all rows, but the description does not explain how term completion is recorded or how multiple officer terms for the same member are handled.",
          "[Level 2] LOW: BoardMembership - Both IsActive flag and EndDate are used to indicate active status, which is redundant and may cause inconsistent interpretations.",
          "[Level 3] HIGH: null - The table name is omitted from the description, making it impossible to reference or locate the table in the schema.",

          "[Level 3] MEDIUM: CommitteeMember - The column **AppointedBy** is described as \"Name or identifier\" but no foreign‑key relationship is defined. If it stores a name, it is not normalized; if it stores an identifier, it should reference the Member table.",
          "[Level 3] HIGH: InvoiceLineItem - The polymorphic columns **RelatedEntityType** and **RelatedEntityID** imply references to Event, Membership, or Course, yet no foreign‑key constraints or documentation are provided, leaving the relationship ambiguous.",
          "[Level 3] LOW: InvoicePayment - The status values are listed as \"Completed or Failed\" but the description does not explain how a payment can be both scheduled (PaymentDate) and later fail, nor how ProcessedDate behaves in each case.",
          "[Level 4] HIGH: Enrollment - InvoiceID is described as a reference to an invoice but no foreign key relationship, target table, or cardinality is defined, leaving the linkage ambiguous.",
          "[Level 4] MEDIUM: Certificate - The description implies a one‑to‑one link (one certificate per enrollment) but does not state the cardinality; without clarification, multiple certificates could be linked to a single enrollment, which conflicts with typical business logic.",
          "[Level 0] HIGH: Membership - The term \"Membership\" is used for the lookup of membership categories, while \"Member\" is used for individual persons (e.g., BoardMember, CampaignMember, ChapterMembership). This creates ambiguity about whether a row represents a person or a membership tier, especially when both are referenced by other tables.",
          "[Level 0] MEDIUM: Campaign - Campaigns are described as having a target audience, but there is no defined foreign‑key relationship to the Segment table that stores audience definitions. The only referenced table is CampaignMember, which links campaigns to members, leaving unclear how segment‑based targeting is implemented.",
          "[Level 1] MEDIUM: Session - The Session table stores the speaker as a free‑text column (SpeakerName) instead of a foreign key to a Person/Member entity. This prevents enforcing referential integrity and creates ambiguity about whether speakers are members, external presenters, or both.",
          "[Level 1] LOW: Session - Columns such as Room and SessionType are stored as plain text without reference to standardized lookup tables (e.g., Room, SessionType). This limits consistency across events."

Be specific about the real-world entities or business processes it represents.\n2. **Reasoning**: Reference specific evidence (column names, FK relationships, sample values, cardinality patterns)\n3. **Confidence**: 0-1 scale. Be conservative. Use < 0.7 if ambiguous.\n4. **Column Descriptions**: Every column should be described. Explain its role and meaning.\n5. **Foreign Keys**: **CRITICAL** - Use structured format for ALL foreign key relationships:\n   - Include EVERY column that references another table\n   - Use EXACT schema and table names from the \"All Database Tables\" list above\n   - Specify confidence (0-1 scale) based on evidence strength\n   - Example: If `prd_id` exists, add: `{\"columnName\": \"prd_id\", \"referencesSchema\": \"inv\", \"referencesTable\": \"prd\", \"referencesColumn\": \"prd_id\", \"confidence\": 0.95}`\n   - **Leave empty array if no foreign keys detected**\n6. **Business Domain**: Infer from table name and purpose (e.g., \"Sales\", \"HR\", \"Inventory\", \"Billing\", \"Security\")\n7. **Parent Table Insights**: If analyzing this child table reveals new information about parent tables, include it. Examples:\n   - Discovering enum values in the parent (e.g., \"Member table has a 'Type' column with values: Individual, Corporate, Student\")\n   - Revealing parent table classification/purpose (e.g., \"BoardMember reveals that Member table includes leadership roles, not just general members\")\n   - Identifying parent table patterns (e.g., \"Multiple child tables suggest Organization serves as a multi-tenant partition key\")\n   - **Leave empty array if no new insights about parents**\n\n**Important:**\n- **When mentioning table names in descriptions, ALWAYS use the exact `schema.table` format from the \"All Database Tables\" list**\n- If column has low cardinality (< 20 distinct values), those are likely enum/category values - use them to understand meaning\n- Foreign keys reveal relationships and context - use parent table descriptions to inform your analysis\n- High uniqueness ratio (> 95%) suggests identifier/code column\n- String length patterns can reveal format (e.g., phone, email, code)\n- Null percentage reveals whether column is required or optional\n\nReturn ONLY valid JSON. Do not include markdown code fences or explanatory text.\n",

Be specific about the real-world entities or business processes it represents.\n2. **Reasoning**: Reference specific evidence (column names, FK relationships, sample values, cardinality patterns)\n3. **Confidence**: 0-1 scale. Be conservative. Use < 0.7 if ambiguous.\n4. **Column Descriptions**: Every column should be described. Explain its role and meaning.\n5. **Foreign Keys**: **CRITICAL** - Use structured format for ALL foreign key relationships:\n   - Include EVERY column that references another table\n   - Use EXACT schema and table names from the \"All Database Tables\" list above\n   - Specify confidence (0-1 scale) based on evidence strength\n   - Example: If `prd_id` exists, add: `{\"columnName\": \"prd_id\", \"referencesSchema\": \"inv\", \"referencesTable\": \"prd\", \"referencesColumn\": \"prd_id\", \"confidence\": 0.95}`\n   - **Leave empty array if no foreign keys detected**\n6. **Business Domain**: Infer from table name and purpose (e.g., \"Sales\", \"HR\", \"Inventory\", \"Billing\", \"Security\")\n7. **Parent Table Insights**: If analyzing this child table reveals new information about parent tables, include it. Examples:\n   - Discovering enum values in the parent (e.g., \"Member table has a 'Type' column with values: Individual, Corporate, Student\")\n   - Revealing parent table classification/purpose (e.g., \"BoardMember reveals that Member table includes leadership roles, not just general members\")\n   - Identifying parent table patterns (e.g., \"Multiple child tables suggest Organization serves as a multi-tenant partition key\")\n   - **Leave empty array if no new insights about parents**\n\n**Important:**\n- **When mentioning table names in descriptions, ALWAYS use the exact `schema.table` format from the \"All Database Tables\" list**\n- If column has low cardinality (< 20 distinct values), those are likely enum/category values - use them to understand meaning\n- Foreign keys reveal relationships and context - use parent table descriptions to inform your analysis\n- High uniqueness ratio (> 95%) suggests identifier/code column\n- String length patterns can reveal format (e.g., phone, email, code)\n- Null percentage reveals whether column is required or optional\n\nReturn ONLY valid JSON. Do not include markdown code fences or explanatory text.\n",

Be conservative. Use < 0.7 if ambiguous.\n4. **Column Descriptions**: Every column should be described. Explain its role and meaning.\n5. **Foreign Keys**: **CRITICAL** - Use structured format for ALL foreign key relationships:\n   - Include EVERY column that references another table\n   - Use EXACT schema and table names from the \"All Database Tables\" list above\n   - Specify confidence (0-1 scale) based on evidence strength\n   - Example: If `prd_id` exists, add: `{\"columnName\": \"prd_id\", \"referencesSchema\": \"inv\", \"referencesTable\": \"prd\", \"referencesColumn\": \"prd_id\", \"confidence\": 0.95}`\n   - **Leave empty array if no foreign keys detected**\n6. **Business Domain**: Infer from table name and purpose (e.g., \"Sales\", \"HR\", \"Inventory\", \"Billing\", \"Security\")\n7. **Parent Table Insights**: If analyzing this child table reveals new information about parent tables, include it. Examples:\n   - Discovering enum values in the parent (e.g., \"Member table has a 'Type' column with values: Individual, Corporate, Student\")\n   - Revealing parent table classification/purpose (e.g., \"BoardMember reveals that Member table includes leadership roles, not just general members\")\n   - Identifying parent table patterns (e.g., \"Multiple child tables suggest Organization serves as a multi-tenant partition key\")\n   - **Leave empty array if no new insights about parents**\n\n**Important:**\n- **When mentioning table names in descriptions, ALWAYS use the exact `schema.table` format from the \"All Database Tables\" list**\n- If column has low cardinality (< 20 distinct values), those are likely enum/category values - use them to understand meaning\n- Foreign keys reveal relationships and context - use parent table descriptions to inform your analysis\n- High uniqueness ratio (> 95%) suggests identifier/code column\n- String length patterns can reveal format (e.g., phone, email, code)\n- Null percentage reveals whether column is required or optional\n\nReturn ONLY valid JSON.

Examples:\n   - Discovering enum values in the parent (e.g., \"Member table has a 'Type' column with values: Individual, Corporate, Student\")\n   - Revealing parent table classification/purpose (e.g., \"BoardMember reveals that Member table includes leadership roles, not just general members\")\n   - Identifying parent table patterns (e.g., \"Multiple child tables suggest Organization serves as a multi-tenant partition key\")\n   - **Leave empty array if no new insights about parents**\n\n**Important:**\n- **When mentioning table names in descriptions, ALWAYS use the exact `schema.table` format from the \"All Database Tables\" list**\n- If column has low cardinality (< 20 distinct values), those are likely enum/category values - use them to understand meaning\n- Foreign keys reveal relationships and context - use parent table descriptions to inform your analysis\n- High uniqueness ratio (> 95%) suggests identifier/code column\n- String length patterns can reveal format (e.g., phone, email, code)\n- Null percentage reveals whether column is required or optional\n\nReturn ONLY valid JSON.

Be specific about the real-world entities or business processes it represents.\n2. **Reasoning**: Reference specific evidence (column names, FK relationships, sample values, cardinality patterns)\n3. **Confidence**: 0-1 scale. Be conservative. Use < 0.7 if ambiguous.\n4. **Column Descriptions**: Every column should be described. Explain its role and meaning.\n5. **Foreign Keys**: **CRITICAL** - Use structured format for ALL foreign key relationships:\n   - Include EVERY column that references another table\n   - Use EXACT schema and table names from the \"All Database Tables\" list above\n   - Specify confidence (0-1 scale) based on evidence strength\n   - Example: If `prd_id` exists, add: `{\"columnName\": \"prd_id\", \"referencesSchema\": \"inv\", \"referencesTable\": \"prd\", \"referencesColumn\": \"prd_id\", \"confidence\": 0.95}`\n   - **Leave empty array if no foreign keys detected**\n6. **Business Domain**: Infer from table name and purpose (e.g., \"Sales\", \"HR\", \"Inventory\", \"Billing\", \"Security\")\n7. **Parent Table Insights**: If analyzing this child table reveals new information about parent tables, include it. Examples:\n   - Discovering enum values in the parent (e.g., \"Member table has a 'Type' column with values: Individual, Corporate, Student\")\n   - Revealing parent table classification/purpose (e.g., \"BoardMember reveals that Member table includes leadership roles, not just general members\")\n   - Identifying parent table patterns (e.g., \"Multiple child tables suggest Organization serves as a multi-tenant partition key\")\n   - **Leave empty array if no new insights about parents**\n\n**Important:**\n- **When mentioning table names in descriptions, ALWAYS use the exact `schema.table` format from the \"All Database Tables\" list**\n- If column has low cardinality (< 20 distinct values), those are likely enum/category values - use them to understand meaning\n- Foreign keys reveal relationships and context - use parent table descriptions to inform your analysis\n- High uniqueness ratio (> 95%) suggests identifier/code column\n- String length patterns can reveal format (e.g., phone, email, code)\n- Null percentage reveals whether column is required or optional\n\nReturn ONLY valid JSON.

Be specific about the real-world entities or business processes it represents.\n2. **Reasoning**: Reference specific evidence (column names, FK relationships, sample values, cardinality patterns)\n3. **Confidence**: 0-1 scale. Be conservative. Use < 0.7 if ambiguous.\n4. **Column Descriptions**: Every column should be described. Explain its role and meaning.\n5. **Foreign Keys**: **CRITICAL** - Use structured format for ALL foreign key relationships:\n   - Include EVERY column that references another table\n   - Use EXACT schema and table names from the \"All Database Tables\" list above\n   - Specify confidence (0-1 scale) based on evidence strength\n   - Example: If `prd_id` exists, add: `{\"columnName\": \"prd_id\", \"referencesSchema\": \"inv\", \"referencesTable\": \"prd\", \"referencesColumn\": \"prd_id\", \"confidence\": 0.95}`\n   - **Leave empty array if no foreign keys detected**\n6. **Business Domain**: Infer from table name and purpose (e.g., \"Sales\", \"HR\", \"Inventory\", \"Billing\", \"Security\")\n7. **Parent Table Insights**: If analyzing this child table reveals new information about parent tables, include it. Examples:\n   - Discovering enum values in the parent (e.g., \"Member table has a 'Type' column with values: Individual, Corporate, Student\")\n   - Revealing parent table classification/purpose (e.g., \"BoardMember reveals that Member table includes leadership roles, not just general members\")\n   - Identifying parent table patterns (e.g., \"Multiple child tables suggest Organization serves as a multi-tenant partition key\")\n   - **Leave empty array if no new insights about parents**\n\n**Important:**\n- **When mentioning table names in descriptions, ALWAYS use the exact `schema.table` format from the \"All Database Tables\" list**\n- If column has low cardinality (< 20 distinct values), those are likely enum/category values - use them to understand meaning\n- Foreign keys reveal relationships and context - use parent table descriptions to inform your analysis\n- High uniqueness ratio (> 95%) suggests identifier/code column\n- String length patterns can reveal format (e.g., phone, email, code)\n- Null percentage reveals whether column is required or optional\n\nReturn ONLY valid JSON.

Be specific about the real-world entities or business processes it represents.\n2. **Reasoning**: Reference specific evidence (column names, FK relationships, sample values, cardinality patterns)\n3. **Confidence**: 0-1 scale. Be conservative. Use < 0.7 if ambiguous.\n4. **Column Descriptions**: Every column should be described. Explain its role and meaning.\n5. **Foreign Keys**: **CRITICAL** - Use structured format for ALL foreign key relationships:\n   - Include EVERY column that references another table\n   - Use EXACT schema and table names from the \"All Database Tables\" list above\n   - Specify confidence (0-1 scale) based on evidence strength\n   - Example: If `prd_id` exists, add: `{\"columnName\": \"prd_id\", \"referencesSchema\": \"inv\", \"referencesTable\": \"prd\", \"referencesColumn\": \"prd_id\", \"confidence\": 0.95}`\n   - **Leave empty array if no foreign keys detected**\n6. **Business Domain**: Infer from table name and purpose (e.g., \"Sales\", \"HR\", \"Inventory\", \"Billing\", \"Security\")\n7. **Parent Table Insights**: If analyzing this child table reveals new information about parent tables, include it. Examples:\n   - Discovering enum values in the parent (e.g., \"Member table has a 'Type' column with values: Individual, Corporate, Student\")\n   - Revealing parent table classification/purpose (e.g., \"BoardMember reveals that Member table includes leadership roles, not just general members\")\n   - Identifying parent table patterns (e.g., \"Multiple child tables suggest Organization serves as a multi-tenant partition key\")\n   - **Leave empty array if no new insights about parents**\n\n**Important:**\n- **When mentioning table names in descriptions, ALWAYS use the exact `schema.table` format from the \"All Database Tables\" list**\n- If column has low cardinality (< 20 distinct values), those are likely enum/category values - use them to understand meaning\n- Foreign keys reveal relationships and context - use parent table descriptions to inform your analysis\n- High uniqueness ratio (> 95%) suggests identifier/code column\n- String length patterns can reveal format (e.g., phone, email, code)\n- Null percentage reveals whether column is required or optional\n\nReturn ONLY valid JSON. Do not include markdown code fences or explanatory text.\n",

Be specific about the real-world entities or business processes it represents.\n2. **Reasoning**: Reference specific evidence (column names, FK relationships, sample values, cardinality patterns)\n3. **Confidence**: 0-1 scale. Be conservative. Use < 0.7 if ambiguous.\n4. **Column Descriptions**: Every column should be described. Explain its role and meaning.\n5. **Foreign Keys**: **CRITICAL** - Use structured format for ALL foreign key relationships:\n   - Include EVERY column that references another table\n   - Use EXACT schema and table names from the \"All Database Tables\" list above\n   - Specify confidence (0-1 scale) based on evidence strength\n   - Example: If `prd_id` exists, add: `{\"columnName\": \"prd_id\", \"referencesSchema\": \"inv\", \"referencesTable\": \"prd\", \"referencesColumn\": \"prd_id\", \"confidence\": 0.95}`\n   - **Leave empty array if no foreign keys detected**\n6. **Business Domain**: Infer from table name and purpose (e.g., \"Sales\", \"HR\", \"Inventory\", \"Billing\", \"Security\")\n7. **Parent Table Insights**: If analyzing this child table reveals new information about parent tables, include it. Examples:\n   - Discovering enum values in the parent (e.g., \"Member table has a 'Type' column with values: Individual, Corporate, Student\")\n   - Revealing parent table classification/purpose (e.g., \"BoardMember reveals that Member table includes leadership roles, not just general members\")\n   - Identifying parent table patterns (e.g., \"Multiple child tables suggest Organization serves as a multi-tenant partition key\")\n   - **Leave empty array if no new insights about parents**\n\n**Important:**\n- **When mentioning table names in descriptions, ALWAYS use the exact `schema.table` format from the \"All Database Tables\" list**\n- If column has low cardinality (< 20 distinct values), those are likely enum/category values - use them to understand meaning\n- Foreign keys reveal relationships and context - use parent table descriptions to inform your analysis\n- High uniqueness ratio (> 95%) suggests identifier/code column\n- String length patterns can reveal format (e.g., phone, email, code)\n- Null percentage reveals whether column is required or optional\n\nReturn ONLY valid JSON.

only use the exact names listed above.\n\n\n---\n\n## Your Task\n\nBased on the evidence above, generate a JSON response with this exact structure:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"tableDescription\": \"A clear, concise description of what this table stores and its purpose in the database\",\n  \"reasoning\": \"Explain the evidence that led to this conclusion (column names, data types, relationships, sample values, etc.)\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.95,\n  \"columnDescriptions\": [\n    {\n      \"columnName\": \"ColumnName\",\n      \"description\": \"What this column represents and why it exists\",\n      \"reasoning\": \"Brief explanation of the evidence\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"foreignKeys\": [\n    {\n      \"columnName\": \"prd_id\",\n      \"referencesSchema\": \"inv\",\n      \"referencesTable\": \"prd\",\n      \"referencesColumn\": \"prd_id\",\n      \"confidence\": 0.95\n    }\n  ],\n  \"inferredBusinessDomain\": \"Sales\",\n  \"parentTableInsights\": [\n    {\n      \"parentTable\": \"schema.table\",\n      \"insight\": \"What this analysis reveals about the parent table that wasn't known before\",\n      \"confidence\": 0.85\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n**Guidelines:**\n1. **Table Description**: Focus on WHAT the table stores and WHY it exists. Be specific about the real-world entities or business processes it represents.\n2. **Reasoning**: Reference specific evidence (column names, FK relationships, sample values, cardinality patterns)\n3. **Confidence**: 0-1 scale. Be conservative. Use < 0.7 if ambiguous.\n4. **Column Descriptions**: Every column should be described. Explain its role and meaning.\n5. **Foreign Keys**: **CRITICAL** - Use structured format for ALL foreign key relationships:\n   - Include EVERY column that references another table\n   - Use EXACT schema and table names from the \"All Database Tables\" list above\n   - Specify confidence (0-1 scale) based on evidence strength\n   - Example: If `prd_id` exists, add: `{\"columnName\": \"prd_id\", \"referencesSchema\": \"inv\", \"referencesTable\": \"prd\", \"referencesColumn\": \"prd_id\", \"confidence\": 0.95}`\n   - **Leave empty array if no foreign keys detected**\n6. **Business Domain**: Infer from table name and purpose (e.g., \"Sales\", \"HR\", \"Inventory\", \"Billing\", \"Security\")\n7. **Parent Table Insights**: If analyzing this child table reveals new information about parent tables, include it. Examples:\n   - Discovering enum values in the parent (e.g., \"Member table has a 'Type' column with values: Individual, Corporate, Student\")\n   - Revealing parent table classification/purpose (e.g., \"BoardMember reveals that Member table includes leadership roles, not just general members\")\n   - Identifying parent table patterns (e.g., \"Multiple child tables suggest Organization serves as a multi-tenant partition key\")\n   - **Leave empty array if no new insights about parents**\n\n**Important:**\n- **When mentioning table names in descriptions, ALWAYS use the exact `schema.table` format from the \"All Database Tables\" list**\n- If column has low cardinality (< 20 distinct values), those are likely enum/category values - use them to understand meaning\n- Foreign keys reveal relationships and context - use parent table descriptions to inform your analysis\n- High uniqueness ratio (> 95%) suggests identifier/code column\n- String length patterns can reveal format (e.g., phone, email, code)\n- Null percentage reveals whether column is required or optional\n\nReturn ONLY valid JSON. Do not include markdown code fences or explanatory text.\n",

Be specific about the real-world entities or business processes it represents.\n2. **Reasoning**: Reference specific evidence (column names, FK relationships, sample values, cardinality patterns)\n3. **Confidence**: 0-1 scale. Be conservative. Use < 0.7 if ambiguous.\n4. **Column Descriptions**: Every column should be described. Explain its role and meaning.\n5. **Foreign Keys**: **CRITICAL** - Use structured format for ALL foreign key relationships:\n   - Include EVERY column that references another table\n   - Use EXACT schema and table names from the \"All Database Tables\" list above\n   - Specify confidence (0-1 scale) based on evidence strength\n   - Example: If `prd_id` exists, add: `{\"columnName\": \"prd_id\", \"referencesSchema\": \"inv\", \"referencesTable\": \"prd\", \"referencesColumn\": \"prd_id\", \"confidence\": 0.95}`\n   - **Leave empty array if no foreign keys detected**\n6. **Business Domain**: Infer from table name and purpose (e.g., \"Sales\", \"HR\", \"Inventory\", \"Billing\", \"Security\")\n7. **Parent Table Insights**: If analyzing this child table reveals new information about parent tables, include it. Examples:\n   - Discovering enum values in the parent (e.g., \"Member table has a 'Type' column with values: Individual, Corporate, Student\")\n   - Revealing parent table classification/purpose (e.g., \"BoardMember reveals that Member table includes leadership roles, not just general members\")\n   - Identifying parent table patterns (e.g., \"Multiple child tables suggest Organization serves as a multi-tenant partition key\")\n   - **Leave empty array if no new insights about parents**\n\n**Important:**\n- **When mentioning table names in descriptions, ALWAYS use the exact `schema.table` format from the \"All Database Tables\" list**\n- If column has low cardinality (< 20 distinct values), those are likely enum/category values - use them to understand meaning\n- Foreign keys reveal relationships and context - use parent table descriptions to inform your analysis\n- High uniqueness ratio (> 95%) suggests identifier/code column\n- String length patterns can reveal format (e.g., phone, email, code)\n- Null percentage reveals whether column is required or optional\n\nReturn ONLY valid JSON. Do not include markdown code fences or explanatory text.\n",

Be specific about the real-world entities or business processes it represents.\n2. **Reasoning**: Reference specific evidence (column names, FK relationships, sample values, cardinality patterns)\n3. **Confidence**: 0-1 scale. Be conservative. Use < 0.7 if ambiguous.\n4. **Column Descriptions**: Every column should be described. Explain its role and meaning.\n5. **Foreign Keys**: **CRITICAL** - Use structured format for ALL foreign key relationships:\n   - Include EVERY column that references another table\n   - Use EXACT schema and table names from the \"All Database Tables\" list above\n   - Specify confidence (0-1 scale) based on evidence strength\n   - Example: If `prd_id` exists, add: `{\"columnName\": \"prd_id\", \"referencesSchema\": \"inv\", \"referencesTable\": \"prd\", \"referencesColumn\": \"prd_id\", \"confidence\": 0.95}`\n   - **Leave empty array if no foreign keys detected**\n6. **Business Domain**: Infer from table name and purpose (e.g., \"Sales\", \"HR\", \"Inventory\", \"Billing\", \"Security\")\n7. **Parent Table Insights**: If analyzing this child table reveals new information about parent tables, include it. Examples:\n   - Discovering enum values in the parent (e.g., \"Member table has a 'Type' column with values: Individual, Corporate, Student\")\n   - Revealing parent table classification/purpose (e.g., \"BoardMember reveals that Member table includes leadership roles, not just general members\")\n   - Identifying parent table patterns (e.g., \"Multiple child tables suggest Organization serves as a multi-tenant partition key\")\n   - **Leave empty array if no new insights about parents**\n\n**Important:**\n- **When mentioning table names in descriptions, ALWAYS use the exact `schema.table` format from the \"All Database Tables\" list**\n- If column has low cardinality (< 20 distinct values), those are likely enum/category values - use them to understand meaning\n- Foreign keys reveal relationships and context - use parent table descriptions to inform your analysis\n- High uniqueness ratio (> 95%) suggests identifier/code column\n- String length patterns can reveal format (e.g., phone, email, code)\n- Null percentage reveals whether column is required or optional\n\nReturn ONLY valid JSON.

Be specific about the real-world entities or business processes it represents.\n2. **Reasoning**: Reference specific evidence (column names, FK relationships, sample values, cardinality patterns)\n3. **Confidence**: 0-1 scale. Be conservative. Use < 0.7 if ambiguous.\n4. **Column Descriptions**: Every column should be described. Explain its role and meaning.\n5. **Foreign Keys**: **CRITICAL** - Use structured format for ALL foreign key relationships:\n   - Include EVERY column that references another table\n   - Use EXACT schema and table names from the \"All Database Tables\" list above\n   - Specify confidence (0-1 scale) based on evidence strength\n   - Example: If `prd_id` exists, add: `{\"columnName\": \"prd_id\", \"referencesSchema\": \"inv\", \"referencesTable\": \"prd\", \"referencesColumn\": \"prd_id\", \"confidence\": 0.95}`\n   - **Leave empty array if no foreign keys detected**\n6. **Business Domain**: Infer from table name and purpose (e.g., \"Sales\", \"HR\", \"Inventory\", \"Billing\", \"Security\")\n7. **Parent Table Insights**: If analyzing this child table reveals new information about parent tables, include it. Examples:\n   - Discovering enum values in the parent (e.g., \"Member table has a 'Type' column with values: Individual, Corporate, Student\")\n   - Revealing parent table classification/purpose (e.g., \"BoardMember reveals that Member table includes leadership roles, not just general members\")\n   - Identifying parent table patterns (e.g., \"Multiple child tables suggest Organization serves as a multi-tenant partition key\")\n   - **Leave empty array if no new insights about parents**\n\n**Important:**\n- **When mentioning table names in descriptions, ALWAYS use the exact `schema.table` format from the \"All Database Tables\" list**\n- If column has low cardinality (< 20 distinct values), those are likely enum/category values - use them to understand meaning\n- Foreign keys reveal relationships and context - use parent table descriptions to inform your analysis\n- High uniqueness ratio (> 95%) suggests identifier/code column\n- String length patterns can reveal format (e.g., phone, email, code)\n- Null percentage reveals whether column is required or optional\n\nReturn ONLY valid JSON. Do not include markdown code fences or explanatory text.\n",

Examples:\n   - Discovering enum values in the parent (e.g., \"Member table has a 'Type' column with values: Individual, Corporate, Student\")\n   - Revealing parent table classification/purpose (e.g., \"BoardMember reveals that Member table includes leadership roles, not just general members\")\n   - Identifying parent table patterns (e.g., \"Multiple child tables suggest Organization serves as a multi-tenant partition key\")\n   - **Leave empty array if no new insights about parents**\n\n**Important:**\n- **When mentioning table names in descriptions, ALWAYS use the exact `schema.table` format from the \"All Database Tables\" list**\n- If column has low cardinality (< 20 distinct values), those are likely enum/category values - use them to understand meaning\n- Foreign keys reveal relationships and context - use parent table descriptions to inform your analysis\n- High uniqueness ratio (> 95%) suggests identifier/code column\n- String length patterns can reveal format (e.g., phone, email, code)\n- Null percentage reveals whether column is required or optional\n\nReturn ONLY valid JSON.

Explain its role and meaning.\n5. **Foreign Keys**: **CRITICAL** - Use structured format for ALL foreign key relationships:\n   - Include EVERY column that references another table\n   - Use EXACT schema and table names from the \"All Database Tables\" list above\n   - Specify confidence (0-1 scale) based on evidence strength\n   - Example: If `prd_id` exists, add: `{\"columnName\": \"prd_id\", \"referencesSchema\": \"inv\", \"referencesTable\": \"prd\", \"referencesColumn\": \"prd_id\", \"confidence\": 0.95}`\n   - **Leave empty array if no foreign keys detected**\n6. **Business Domain**: Infer from table name and purpose (e.g., \"Sales\", \"HR\", \"Inventory\", \"Billing\", \"Security\")\n7. **Parent Table Insights**: If analyzing this child table reveals new information about parent tables, include it. Examples:\n   - Discovering enum values in the parent (e.g., \"Member table has a 'Type' column with values: Individual, Corporate, Student\")\n   - Revealing parent table classification/purpose (e.g., \"BoardMember reveals that Member table includes leadership roles, not just general members\")\n   - Identifying parent table patterns (e.g., \"Multiple child tables suggest Organization serves as a multi-tenant partition key\")\n   - **Leave empty array if no new insights about parents**\n\n**Important:**\n- **When mentioning table names in descriptions, ALWAYS use the exact `schema.table` format from the \"All Database Tables\" list**\n- If column has low cardinality (< 20 distinct values), those are likely enum/category values - use them to understand meaning\n- Foreign keys reveal relationships and context - use parent table descriptions to inform your analysis\n- High uniqueness ratio (> 95%) suggests identifier/code column\n- String length patterns can reveal format (e.g., phone, email, code)\n- Null percentage reveals whether column is required or optional\n\nReturn ONLY valid JSON.

Be specific about the real-world entities or business processes it represents.\n2. **Reasoning**: Reference specific evidence (column names, FK relationships, sample values, cardinality patterns)\n3. **Confidence**: 0-1 scale. Be conservative. Use < 0.7 if ambiguous.\n4. **Column Descriptions**: Every column should be described. Explain its role and meaning.\n5. **Foreign Keys**: **CRITICAL** - Use structured format for ALL foreign key relationships:\n   - Include EVERY column that references another table\n   - Use EXACT schema and table names from the \"All Database Tables\" list above\n   - Specify confidence (0-1 scale) based on evidence strength\n   - Example: If `prd_id` exists, add: `{\"columnName\": \"prd_id\", \"referencesSchema\": \"inv\", \"referencesTable\": \"prd\", \"referencesColumn\": \"prd_id\", \"confidence\": 0.95}`\n   - **Leave empty array if no foreign keys detected**\n6. **Business Domain**: Infer from table name and purpose (e.g., \"Sales\", \"HR\", \"Inventory\", \"Billing\", \"Security\")\n7. **Parent Table Insights**: If analyzing this child table reveals new information about parent tables, include it. Examples:\n   - Discovering enum values in the parent (e.g., \"Member table has a 'Type' column with values: Individual, Corporate, Student\")\n   - Revealing parent table classification/purpose (e.g., \"BoardMember reveals that Member table includes leadership roles, not just general members\")\n   - Identifying parent table patterns (e.g., \"Multiple child tables suggest Organization serves as a multi-tenant partition key\")\n   - **Leave empty array if no new insights about parents**\n\n**Important:**\n- **When mentioning table names in descriptions, ALWAYS use the exact `schema.table` format from the \"All Database Tables\" list**\n- If column has low cardinality (< 20 distinct values), those are likely enum/category values - use them to understand meaning\n- Foreign keys reveal relationships and context - use parent table descriptions to inform your analysis\n- High uniqueness ratio (> 95%) suggests identifier/code column\n- String length patterns can reveal format (e.g., phone, email, code)\n- Null percentage reveals whether column is required or optional\n\nReturn ONLY valid JSON.

Be specific about the real-world entities or business processes it represents.\n2. **Reasoning**: Reference specific evidence (column names, FK relationships, sample values, cardinality patterns)\n3. **Confidence**: 0-1 scale. Be conservative. Use < 0.7 if ambiguous.\n4. **Column Descriptions**: Every column should be described. Explain its role and meaning.\n5. **Foreign Keys**: **CRITICAL** - Use structured format for ALL foreign key relationships:\n   - Include EVERY column that references another table\n   - Use EXACT schema and table names from the \"All Database Tables\" list above\n   - Specify confidence (0-1 scale) based on evidence strength\n   - Example: If `prd_id` exists, add: `{\"columnName\": \"prd_id\", \"referencesSchema\": \"inv\", \"referencesTable\": \"prd\", \"referencesColumn\": \"prd_id\", \"confidence\": 0.95}`\n   - **Leave empty array if no foreign keys detected**\n6. **Business Domain**: Infer from table name and purpose (e.g., \"Sales\", \"HR\", \"Inventory\", \"Billing\", \"Security\")\n7. **Parent Table Insights**: If analyzing this child table reveals new information about parent tables, include it. Examples:\n   - Discovering enum values in the parent (e.g., \"Member table has a 'Type' column with values: Individual, Corporate, Student\")\n   - Revealing parent table classification/purpose (e.g., \"BoardMember reveals that Member table includes leadership roles, not just general members\")\n   - Identifying parent table patterns (e.g., \"Multiple child tables suggest Organization serves as a multi-tenant partition key\")\n   - **Leave empty array if no new insights about parents**\n\n**Important:**\n- **When mentioning table names in descriptions, ALWAYS use the exact `schema.table` format from the \"All Database Tables\" list**\n- If column has low cardinality (< 20 distinct values), those are likely enum/category values - use them to understand meaning\n- Foreign keys reveal relationships and context - use parent table descriptions to inform your analysis\n- High uniqueness ratio (> 95%) suggests identifier/code column\n- String length patterns can reveal format (e.g., phone, email, code)\n- Null percentage reveals whether column is required or optional\n\nReturn ONLY valid JSON. Do not include markdown code fences or explanatory text.\n",

Be specific about the real-world entities or business processes it represents.\n2. **Reasoning**: Reference specific evidence (column names, FK relationships, sample values, cardinality patterns)\n3. **Confidence**: 0-1 scale. Be conservative. Use < 0.7 if ambiguous.\n4. **Column Descriptions**: Every column should be described. Explain its role and meaning.\n5. **Foreign Keys**: **CRITICAL** - Use structured format for ALL foreign key relationships:\n   - Include EVERY column that references another table\n   - Use EXACT schema and table names from the \"All Database Tables\" list above\n   - Specify confidence (0-1 scale) based on evidence strength\n   - Example: If `prd_id` exists, add: `{\"columnName\": \"prd_id\", \"referencesSchema\": \"inv\", \"referencesTable\": \"prd\", \"referencesColumn\": \"prd_id\", \"confidence\": 0.95}`\n   - **Leave empty array if no foreign keys detected**\n6. **Business Domain**: Infer from table name and purpose (e.g., \"Sales\", \"HR\", \"Inventory\", \"Billing\", \"Security\")\n7. **Parent Table Insights**: If analyzing this child table reveals new information about parent tables, include it. Examples:\n   - Discovering enum values in the parent (e.g., \"Member table has a 'Type' column with values: Individual, Corporate, Student\")\n   - Revealing parent table classification/purpose (e.g., \"BoardMember reveals that Member table includes leadership roles, not just general members\")\n   - Identifying parent table patterns (e.g., \"Multiple child tables suggest Organization serves as a multi-tenant partition key\")\n   - **Leave empty array if no new insights about parents**\n\n**Important:**\n- **When mentioning table names in descriptions, ALWAYS use the exact `schema.table` format from the \"All Database Tables\" list**\n- If column has low cardinality (< 20 distinct values), those are likely enum/category values - use them to understand meaning\n- Foreign keys reveal relationships and context - use parent table descriptions to inform your analysis\n- High uniqueness ratio (> 95%) suggests identifier/code column\n- String length patterns can reveal format (e.g., phone, email, code)\n- Null percentage reveals whether column is required or optional\n\nReturn ONLY valid JSON. Do not include markdown code fences or explanatory text.\n",

Be specific about the real-world entities or business processes it represents.\n2. **Reasoning**: Reference specific evidence (column names, FK relationships, sample values, cardinality patterns)\n3. **Confidence**: 0-1 scale. Be conservative. Use < 0.7 if ambiguous.\n4. **Column Descriptions**: Every column should be described. Explain its role and meaning.\n5. **Foreign Keys**: **CRITICAL** - Use structured format for ALL foreign key relationships:\n   - Include EVERY column that references another table\n   - Use EXACT schema and table names from the \"All Database Tables\" list above\n   - Specify confidence (0-1 scale) based on evidence strength\n   - Example: If `prd_id` exists, add: `{\"columnName\": \"prd_id\", \"referencesSchema\": \"inv\", \"referencesTable\": \"prd\", \"referencesColumn\": \"prd_id\", \"confidence\": 0.95}`\n   - **Leave empty array if no foreign keys detected**\n6. **Business Domain**: Infer from table name and purpose (e.g., \"Sales\", \"HR\", \"Inventory\", \"Billing\", \"Security\")\n7. **Parent Table Insights**: If analyzing this child table reveals new information about parent tables, include it. Examples:\n   - Discovering enum values in the parent (e.g., \"Member table has a 'Type' column with values: Individual, Corporate, Student\")\n   - Revealing parent table classification/purpose (e.g., \"BoardMember reveals that Member table includes leadership roles, not just general members\")\n   - Identifying parent table patterns (e.g., \"Multiple child tables suggest Organization serves as a multi-tenant partition key\")\n   - **Leave empty array if no new insights about parents**\n\n**Important:**\n- **When mentioning table names in descriptions, ALWAYS use the exact `schema.table` format from the \"All Database Tables\" list**\n- If column has low cardinality (< 20 distinct values), those are likely enum/category values - use them to understand meaning\n- Foreign keys reveal relationships and context - use parent table descriptions to inform your analysis\n- High uniqueness ratio (> 95%) suggests identifier/code column\n- String length patterns can reveal format (e.g., phone, email, code)\n- Null percentage reveals whether column is required or optional\n\nReturn ONLY valid JSON. Do not include markdown code fences or explanatory text.\n",

Examples:\n   - Discovering enum values in the parent (e.g., \"Member table has a 'Type' column with values: Individual, Corporate, Student\")\n   - Revealing parent table classification/purpose (e.g., \"BoardMember reveals that Member table includes leadership roles, not just general members\")\n   - Identifying parent table patterns (e.g., \"Multiple child tables suggest Organization serves as a multi-tenant partition key\")\n   - **Leave empty array if no new insights about parents**\n\n**Important:**\n- **When mentioning table names in descriptions, ALWAYS use the exact `schema.table` format from the \"All Database Tables\" list**\n- If column has low cardinality (< 20 distinct values), those are likely enum/category values - use them to understand meaning\n- Foreign keys reveal relationships and context - use parent table descriptions to inform your analysis\n- High uniqueness ratio (> 95%) suggests identifier/code column\n- String length patterns can reveal format (e.g., phone, email, code)\n- Null percentage reveals whether column is required or optional\n\nReturn ONLY valid JSON. Do not include markdown code fences or explanatory text.\n",

Be specific about the real-world entities or business processes it represents.\n2. **Reasoning**: Reference specific evidence (column names, FK relationships, sample values, cardinality patterns)\n3. **Confidence**: 0-1 scale. Be conservative. Use < 0.7 if ambiguous.\n4. **Column Descriptions**: Every column should be described. Explain its role and meaning.\n5. **Foreign Keys**: **CRITICAL** - Use structured format for ALL foreign key relationships:\n   - Include EVERY column that references another table\n   - Use EXACT schema and table names from the \"All Database Tables\" list above\n   - Specify confidence (0-1 scale) based on evidence strength\n   - Example: If `prd_id` exists, add: `{\"columnName\": \"prd_id\", \"referencesSchema\": \"inv\", \"referencesTable\": \"prd\", \"referencesColumn\": \"prd_id\", \"confidence\": 0.95}`\n   - **Leave empty array if no foreign keys detected**\n6. **Business Domain**: Infer from table name and purpose (e.g., \"Sales\", \"HR\", \"Inventory\", \"Billing\", \"Security\")\n7. **Parent Table Insights**: If analyzing this child table reveals new information about parent tables, include it. Examples:\n   - Discovering enum values in the parent (e.g., \"Member table has a 'Type' column with values: Individual, Corporate, Student\")\n   - Revealing parent table classification/purpose (e.g., \"BoardMember reveals that Member table includes leadership roles, not just general members\")\n   - Identifying parent table patterns (e.g., \"Multiple child tables suggest Organization serves as a multi-tenant partition key\")\n   - **Leave empty array if no new insights about parents**\n\n**Important:**\n- **When mentioning table names in descriptions, ALWAYS use the exact `schema.table` format from the \"All Database Tables\" list**\n- If column has low cardinality (< 20 distinct values), those are likely enum/category values - use them to understand meaning\n- Foreign keys reveal relationships and context - use parent table descriptions to inform your analysis\n- High uniqueness ratio (> 95%) suggests identifier/code column\n- String length patterns can reveal format (e.g., phone, email, code)\n- Null percentage reveals whether column is required or optional\n\nReturn ONLY valid JSON.

High uniqueness of most columns and the one‑to‑one relationship (EnrollmentID unique) further confirm the table’s purpose as a certificate repository.",
