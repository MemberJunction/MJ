/**
 * @fileoverview Durable, host-agnostic execution of submitted task graphs.
 *
 * The dispatcher is what makes task graphs survive things the old client-driven path could not: a
 * page reload, the submitting agent run ending, a server restart, or a second server instance
 * running the same table. It polls for claimable work, claims atomically, executes with a fresh
 * provider per task, and reconciles orphaned state on a timer.
 *
 * **What it deliberately does not do.** It does not decide graph semantics. Eligibility, failure
 * propagation, parent rollup and stall detection all come from the pure algorithms in
 * `@memberjunction/ai-core-plus` — the same functions the in-run executor consumes. That is
 * the whole reason those were factored out dependency-free: the in-run executor and the durable
 * executor cannot drift apart if neither owns the rules.
 *
 * **Host-agnostic by construction.** Provider minting and agent execution arrive as injected
 * dependencies (`ProviderFactory`, `TaskAgentRunner`), so this package never imports MJServer. The
 * dependency runs MJServer -> task-graph, never the reverse.
 *
 * @module @memberjunction/task-graph
