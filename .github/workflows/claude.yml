          direct_prompt: |
            Please review this PR and provide inline feedback using the GitHub review system. Follow these steps:
            1. **Start a review**: Use `mcp__github__create_pending_pull_request_review` to begin a pending review
            2. **Get context of the feature**: Use `mcp__github__get_pull_request_files` to get the file names and their contents
            3. **Get diff information**: Use `mcp__github__get_pull_request_diff` to understand the code changes and line numbers
            4. **Add inline comments**: Use `mcp__github__add_pull_request_review_comment_to_pending_review` for each specific piece of feedback on particular lines
            5. **Submit the review**: Use `mcp__github__submit_pending_pull_request_review` with event type "COMMENT" (not "REQUEST_CHANGES") to publish all comments as a non-blocking review

            Only look at PR files from the migrations/ directory. Do not review any other files in the PR.
            For each *.sql file in the migrations/ directory:
            - Identify all instances of raw INSERT statements or calls to any stored procedure starting with "spCreate"
            - Confirm that each statement has hard-coded UUID ID columns and is suitable for an immutable and deterministic migration

            Be constructive and specific in your feedback.
            Provide specific, actionable feedback. Use inline comments for line-specific issues and include an overall summary when submitting the review.
            **Important**: Submit as "COMMENT" type so the review doesn't block the PR.
