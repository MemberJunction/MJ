**Action:**
- Remove all "**NEW:**" markers from README.md
- Keep version numbers (v2.112+)
- Check other files for NEW markers

**Status:** ⏳ Pending

## Comment 5: Remove 'as any' Cast in Loop Agent Validation

**File:** `packages/AI/Agents/src/agent-types/loop-agent-type.ts`
**Line:** 291
**Comment:** "get rid of any casting here and below, this was before the nextStep was updated and it now has this in it!"

**Context:** `(response.nextStep as any).forEach` - nextStep now properly has forEach field

**Action:** Remove all `as any` casts when accessing forEach/while from response.nextStep

**Status:** ⏳ Pending

## Comment 6: Remove 'as any' Cast for While Access

**File:** `packages/AI/Agents/src/agent-types/loop-agent-type.ts`
**Line:** 330
**Comment:** "get rid of any cast here too and all other places!"

**Context:** `(response.nextStep as any).while`

**Action:**
- Remove all `as any` casts for while property access
- Find and remove ALL other any casts in loop-agent-type.ts

**Status:** ⏳ Pending

## Comment 8: Refactor createStepEntity Parameters

**File:** `packages/AI/Agents/src/base-agent.ts`
**Line:** 2772
**Comment:** "gotten to have too many params, lets create a single param with props so you pass in that type and less likely to have errors, fix the method signature so it has (params: {stepType, stepName, etc}) and then fix all calls to this to use the new signature correctly, current thing too prone to error"

**Current Signature:**
```typescript
private async createStepEntity(
    stepType, stepName, contextUser, targetId?, inputData?,
    targetLogId?, payloadAtStart?, payloadAtEnd?, parentId?
): Promise<AIAgentRunStepEntityExtended>
```

**New Signature:**
```typescript
private async createStepEntity(params: {
    stepType: AIAgentRunStepEntityExtended["StepType"];
    stepName: string;
    contextUser: UserInfo;
    targetId?: string;
    inputData?: any;
    targetLogId?: string;
    payloadAtStart?: any;
    payloadAtEnd?: any;
    parentId?: string;
}): Promise<AIAgentRunStepEntityExtended>
```

**Action:**
- Refactor createStepEntity signature
- Update ALL calls to use object parameter
- Verify all callers pass correct properties

**Status:** ⏳ Pending

## Comment 9: Verify ParentID Passed for Loop Iterations

**File:** `packages/AI/Agents/src/base-agent.ts`
**Line:** 2790
**Comment:** "make sure we check where we call this method to ensure we pass in parent ID for loop inner steps for both while and for loops"

**Action:**
- Find all createStepEntity calls during loop iterations
- Verify parentId is passed from this._iterationContext?.parentStepId
- Test both ForEach and While loops

**Status:** ⏳ Pending (Should already be correct at line 4362, but verify)
