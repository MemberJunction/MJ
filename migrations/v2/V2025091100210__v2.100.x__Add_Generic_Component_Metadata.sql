Receive raw entity data array\n2. Group by specified field\n3. Aggregate using specified method (count/sum/average)\n4. Sort by value or label as configured\n5. Apply limits if specified (e.g., top 10)\n6. Format for chart library\n7. Render with appropriate chart type\n\n### Chart Type Selection\n- **Bar**: Default for categorical data\n- **Line**: When groupBy field is date/time\n- **Pie/Doughnut**: When showing distribution/percentages\n- **Area**: For cumulative time series\n- User can override automatic selection\n\n### Event System\n- Click events include:\n  - Chart type and series name\n  - Data point value and label\n  - Original records that comprise the data point\n  - Percentage of total if applicable\n- Enables drill-down to detailed views","dataRequirements":{"mode":"props","description":"Component receives entity data through props and performs client-side aggregation"},"properties":[{"name":"entityName","type":"string","description":"Name of the entity being visualized","required":true},{"name":"data","type":"Array<object>","description":"Array of entity objects to visualize","required":true},{"name":"groupBy","type":"string","description":"Field name to group data by","required":true},{"name":"valueField","type":"string","description":"Field to aggregate for values.
