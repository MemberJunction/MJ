Load all accounts via RunView on mount\n2. Group accounts by Industry field client-side\n3. Calculate percentages and prepare chart data\n4. Render pie chart with Chart.js\n5. Filter account list based on selected slice\n6. Load account details when row selected\n7. Persist user preferences via onSaveUserSettings\n\n### Performance Optimizations\n- Use React.memo for chart component\n- Implement useMemo for data grouping\n- Client-side filtering/sorting to reduce server calls\n- Virtual scrolling for very large lists (future)",

SET
  @FunctionalRequirements_a936785a = N'## Accounts by Industry Dashboard

### Core Functionality
- Display an interactive pie chart showing account distribution across industries
- Calculate and show percentages for each industry segment
- Support click-to-filter: clicking a pie slice filters the account list below
- Display filtered account list with key information (name, revenue, status)
- Enable row selection to view detailed account information in a slide-in panel
- Provide sorting capabilities on all columns (client-side)
- Implement pagination for large datasets (server-side via RunView)
- Include an ''Open'' button on account details to trigger OpenEntityRecord callback
- Remember user''s last selected industry and sort preferences

### Visual Features
- Smooth hover animations on pie slices with tooltips
- Highlighted state for selected pie slice
- Color-coded legend with industry names and counts
- Responsive layout adapting to different screen sizes
- Loading states during data fetching
- Empty states with helpful messages
- Smooth slide-in animation for detail panel

### Interactive Elements
- Click pie slice to select/deselect and filter accounts
- Click legend items to toggle slice visibility
- Sort columns by clicking headers
- Select account rows to view details
- Close detail panel via X button or clicking outside
- Pagination controls for navigating large datasets'

  @TechnicalDesign_a936785a = N'## Technical Architecture

### Component Structure
- **Root Component (AccountsByIndustry)**: Manages overall state and data loading
- **PieChart (inline)**: Chart.js-based interactive pie visualization
- **AccountList (inline)**: Filtered, sortable table with pagination
- **AccountDetails (inline)**: Sliding panel with comprehensive account info

### State Management
- Selected industry (persisted in savedUserSettings)
- Sort configuration (field, direction) (persisted)
- Current page number
- Selected account ID
- Detail panel visibility
- Loading states for async operations

### Data Flow
1. Load all accounts via RunView on mount
2. Group accounts by Industry field client-side
3. Calculate percentages and prepare chart data
4. Render pie chart with Chart.js
5. Filter account list based on selected slice
6. Load account details when row selected
7. Persist user preferences via onSaveUserSettings

### Performance Optimizations
- Use React.memo for chart component
- Implement useMemo for data grouping
- Client-side filtering/sorting to reduce server calls
- Debounced search if implemented
- Virtual scrolling for very large lists (future)'
