# Explanation of migrations/v2/V202507041631__v2.64.x__PayloadReadWritePaths_AI_Agents.sql
During the development of v2.65.0 - we mistakenly named this file with a v2.64.x name. This file
**was correctly included in MJ v2.65.0** so there is no impact other than the filename. 

## NO ACTION REQUIRED
This mistake has no impact at present or in the future and requires no further attention. This MD file is simply here to explain the issue clearly if there is ever any question about the filename relative to the release it was included in.
