/*
    Durable After* entity-action dispatch (D14).

    THE PROBLEM. `OnAfterSaveExecute` dispatches after-save entity actions fire-and-forget — the
    provider calls `HandleEntityActions` without awaiting it, deliberately, so a user's save is not
    held open by work that happens afterwards. That is right for latency and wrong for durability:
    if the process dies between the save committing and the action finishing, the action is simply
    lost. Nothing retries it, nothing records that it was owed, and the record looks like every
    record whose trigger did run. For "when an invoice is approved, notify accounting" that is a
    missed notification nobody can discover.

    THE FIX IS NOT A NEW QUEUE. Plan decision D14 is explicit that the dispatcher's claim protocol
    is MJ's durable-async substrate going forward, and that new durable work targets
    `TaskGraphService` submission rather than `QueueManager` — a single-node durable graph is
    exactly "run this action durably, with restart recovery and orphan reclaim". Adding a third
    async substrate beside MJQueue and fire-and-forget promises is the thing that decision exists to
    prevent.

    TWO COLUMNS, AND WHY EACH IS NEEDED.

    1. EntityAction.RunMode — per-binding opt-in, defaulting to 'Inline'.
       Durability is not free: it costs a Task row per dispatch, a dispatcher hop of latency, and it
       persists the action's parameters at rest. Making every After* binding on every instance pay
       that would be a large, silent behavioural change to installations that never asked for it. So
       the default preserves today's behaviour exactly and an operator opts a binding in.

       The column lives on EntityAction rather than Action because durability is a property of *this
       binding*, not of the action: the same 'Send Notification' action can reasonably be
       fire-and-forget on a low-stakes entity and durable on an invoice.

    2. Task.ActionID — so a graph node can be an action, not only an agent or a person.
       The dispatcher executes agent-assigned nodes and waits on human ones; there was no third
       shape. Without this column a "run this action durably" graph has nowhere to record WHICH
       action, and the substrate would have to smuggle it through InputPayload — untyped, unjoinable,
       and invisible to every query that asks what a task is.

       CK_Task_Assignment is widened from a two-way exclusivity to a three-way one. Note what it
       still refuses: a task assigned to more than one of user / agent / action. The all-NULL case
       remains legal because it always was — a parent graph row is assigned to nothing.

    WHAT THIS MIGRATION DOES NOT DO. It grants no durability by itself. Every existing binding keeps
    RunMode='Inline' and behaves exactly as before; a new Task.ActionID is NULL on every existing
    row. Turning it on is a per-binding decision made after the fact, which is the shape every other
    maintenance-adjacent feature in this program has taken.

/* HAND CORRECTION TO THE GENERATED SQL BELOW.

   CodeGen emitted LITERAL Sequence values here (100025 / 100057 / 100066) — the numbers that were
   free on the database CodeGen happened to run against. Those numbers are TEMPORARY placeholders
   (MAX + 100000 + ordinal) that spUpdateExistingEntityFieldsFromSchema renumbers moments later,
   which is why they always look right locally.

   They are not right on a database built only from migrations. Flyway runs every versioned
   migration BEFORE any repeatable script, so R__RefreshMetadata's renumber never runs in between —
   and 100025 already belongs to EntityAction.ScopeEntity there. The INSERT then violates
   UQ_EntityField_EntityID_Sequence, and because this script does not SET XACT_ABORT ON, that aborts
   only the STATEMENT. Execution continues and the run dies further down on a FOREIGN KEY error
   against EntityFieldValue, whose rows point at the RunMode field that was never inserted — an
   error that says nothing about the actual cause.

   Each literal is therefore replaced with the next free sequence computed AT APPLY TIME, which
   cannot collide on any database in any order. CodeGen now emits this same form
   (manage-metadata.ts, getPendingEntityFieldINSERTSQL), so future blocks need no hand correction.
