# Event Abstract Submission UI Development Plan

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the comprehensive plan for building a modern, beautiful Angular UI for the Event Abstract Submission demo application. The UI will provide intuitive event management, abstract submission workflows, and speaker management capabilities with a focus on exceptional user experience and clean, contemporary design.

## Project Goals

### Primary Objectives
- Create a beautiful, contemporary Angular UI that's incredibly easy to navigate
- Showcase the complete abstract submission workflow from initial submission to final approval
- Provide comprehensive event management with real-time analytics
- Implement speaker management with rich profile capabilities
- Demonstrate the MemberJunction framework's extensibility patterns

### Key Design Principles
- **Clean & Minimal**: Remove clutter, focus on essential information
- **Intuitive Navigation**: Users should never feel lost
- **Workflow Visualization**: Make complex processes simple to understand
- **Responsive Design**: Perfect experience on all devices
- **Performance**: Fast loading and smooth interactions

## Technical Architecture

### Framework & Libraries
- **Angular 18**: Modern Angular with standalone components
- **Angular Material**: Contemporary design system (instead of Kendo)
- **RxJS**: Reactive programming for state management
- **Marked.js**: Markdown rendering for rich content
- **Chart.js/D3**: Data visualization for analytics
- **Angular CDK**: Advanced UI patterns
- **mj_generatedentities**: App-specific entity imports (NOT @memberjunction/core-entities)

```

### Entity Import Strategy
**Important**: Event entities are NOT in the core-entities package. App-level entities are in `packages/GeneratedEntities` and must be imported from there.

#### Entity Imports
```typescript
// Correct import path for app-specific entities
import { 
  EventEntity, 
  SubmissionEntity, 
  SpeakerEntity, 
  SubmissionSpeakerEntity 
} from 'mj_generatedentities';

// NOT from @memberjunction/core-entities (which only contains framework entities)
```
