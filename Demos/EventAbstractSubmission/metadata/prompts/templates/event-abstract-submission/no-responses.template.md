# No New Submissions Found

I checked the Typeform for new abstract submissions but didn't find any new responses.

**Details:**
- Form ID: {{ payload.typeformFormID }}
- Event ID: {{ payload.eventID }}
- Last checked: {{ payload.lastCheckDate }}
- Responses found: {{ payload.responseCount }}

The system will continue monitoring for new submissions. You can check again later or configure automated polling.
