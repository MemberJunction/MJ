## 🛠️ Development

### Essential Commands

```bash
# Build everything
npm run build

# Build specific package
turbo build --filter="@memberjunction/core"

# Watch mode (auto-rebuild on changes)
npm run watch

# Start services
npm run start:api        # Start API server (port 4000)
npm run start:explorer   # Start Explorer UI (port 4200)

# Code quality
npm run lint            # Run ESLint
npm run format          # Format with Prettier
npm test               # Run tests
```

### Development Workflow

1. **Make changes** in the relevant package under `/packages`
2. **Build the package** using `npm run build` in the package directory
3. **Test locally** using the watch mode for rapid development
4. **Run tests** to ensure nothing is broken
5. **Create a PR** with your changes

### Package Development

Each package follows a consistent structure:
```
packages/MyPackage/
├── src/               # TypeScript source files
├── dist/              # Compiled output
├── package.json       # Package configuration
├── tsconfig.json      # TypeScript configuration
├── README.md          # Package documentation
└── CHANGELOG.md       # Version history
```

## 📋 Key Concepts

### Metadata-Driven Development

MemberJunction's core philosophy is metadata-driven development:
- **Entities** define data structure and relationships
- **Fields** specify data types, validation, and UI hints
- **Views** control data access and filtering
- **Actions** implement business logic
- **Forms** are auto-generated or customized

### Entity System

Entities are the building blocks:
```typescript
// Never instantiate directly - use Metadata
const md = new Metadata();
const customer = await md.GetEntityObject<CustomerEntity>('Customers');
await customer.Load(customerId);
customer.Name = 'New Name';
await customer.Save();
```

### Code Generation

MemberJunction generates code from metadata:
- Entity subclasses with full TypeScript typing
- GraphQL schemas and resolvers
- SQL views and stored procedures
- API documentation

## 🧪 Code Style & Best Practices

### TypeScript Guidelines
- **Strict mode** enabled for all packages
- **No `any` types** - use proper typing or `unknown`
- **Explicit return types** for public methods
- **Interface-first** design for extensibility

### Naming Conventions
- **PascalCase** for classes and interfaces
- **camelCase** for variables and functions
- **UPPER_CASE** for constants
- **Descriptive names** over abbreviations

### Code Organization
- **Single responsibility** - one class, one purpose
- **Dependency injection** where appropriate
- **Error handling** with meaningful messages
- **Logging** at appropriate levels
- **Tests** for critical functionality

## 🐳 Deployment

### Docker Support

MemberJunction includes Docker configuration for containerized deployment:

```bash
# Build the Docker image
docker build -f docker/MJAPI/Dockerfile -t memberjunction/api .

# Run with docker-compose
docker-compose up -d
```

Features:
- Multi-stage build for optimal image size
- Includes SQL Server tools and Flyway migrations
- Environment-based configuration
- Health checks and logging

### Database Migrations

Database changes are managed through Flyway migrations:
- **Versioned migrations** in `/migrations/v2/`
- **Automatic execution** on startup
- **Rollback support** for safe deployments
- **Schema versioning** for upgrade paths

## 🔒 Security
